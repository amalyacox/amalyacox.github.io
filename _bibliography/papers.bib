Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we summarize some important research in the field of image denoising. First, we give the formulation of the image denoising problem, and then we present several image denoising techniques. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of these techniques.

              Combining the best of different monolayers in one ultimate van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure is an appealing approach for practical applications. Recently, a graphene (GR) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe

              ) heterobilayer was successfully fabricated experimentally. The superior electrical conductivity of GR combined with the unique photoelectrical properties and direct bandgap of MoSe
              2
              can yield many potential applications, such as Li-ion batteries, tunneling field effect transistors and two-dimensional non-volatile memory devices. Efficient heat conduction within the device components is of great importance for nanoelectronic performance. In this work, the cross-plane interfacial thermal resistance (
              R
              ) and in-plane thermal conductivity (
              κ
              ) of the GR/MoSe
              2
              vdW heterobilayer are systematically investigated using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The predicted
              R

The attractive functions in heterostructures that are usually absent and beyond the single layer 2D materials are largely aﬀected by the inherent lattice mismatch between layers. Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the phonon thermal transport in the graphene−MoS2 bilayer heterostructure is reduced by the lattice mismatch, and the reduction can be mitigated well by an external tension, weakening the eﬀect of inherent mismatch-induced strain on thermal conductivity. Mechanical analysis in each layered component indicates that the external tension will alleviate the lattice mismatch-induced deformation. The phonon spectra are also softened by the applied tension with a signiﬁcant shift of frequency from high to low modes. A universal theory is proposed to quantitatively predict the role of the lattice mismatch in thermal conductivity of various bilayer heterostructures and shows good agreement with simulations.},

	abstract = {Designing structures with thermal rectiﬁcation performance that can be regulated by or adapted to mechanical deformation is in great demand in wearable electronics. Herein, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, we present an in-plane graphene-boron nitride heterostructure with a controlled interface junction and demonstrate that its thermal transport ability is asymmetric when reversing the direction of heat ﬂow. Such thermal rectiﬁcation performance can be further regulated by applying an external tensile loading due to the mitigation of stress concentration, phonon resonance, and phonon localization. The analyses on heat ﬂow distribution, vibrational spectra, and phonon participation suggest that the out-of-plane phonon modes dominate thermal rectiﬁcation at a small tensile strain, while the mechanical stress plays a dominant role in regulation at a large tensile strain due to the weakened localization of out-of-plane phonon modes. The eﬀect of tensile loading on the thermal rectiﬁcation is demonstrated by selective interface junction-enabled heterostructures, and the results indicate that both asymmetry and direction of thermal transport can be controlled by introducing defects to the interface junction and/or applying mechanical tensile strain. These ﬁndings and models are expected to provide an immediate guidance for designing and manufacturing 2D material-based devices with mechanically tunable thermal management capabilities.},

We provide a new analysis method to understand the physical mechanism of phonon–phonon coupling and the phonon modes’ contributions to the thermal boundary conductance at SLG/h-BN interfaces.
          , 
            Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a promising substrate for graphene based nano-electronic devices. We investigate the ballistic phonon transport at the interface of vertically stacked graphene and h-BN heterostructures using first principles density functional theory and atomistic Green's function simulations considering the influence of lattice stacking. We compute the frequency and wave-vector dependent transmission function and observe distinct stacking-dependent phonon transmission features for the h-BN/graphene/h-BN sandwiched systems. We find that the in-plane acoustic modes have the dominant contributions to the phonon transmission and thermal boundary conductance (TBC) for the interfaces with the carbon atom located directly on top of the boron atom (C–B matched) because of low interfacial spacing. The low interfacial spacing is a consequence of the differences in the effective atomic volume of N and B and the difference in the local electron density around N and B. For the structures with the carbon atom directly on top of the nitrogen atom (C–N matched), the spatial distance increases and the contribution of in-plane modes to the TBC decreases leading to higher contributions by out-of-plane acoustic modes. We find that the C–B matched interfaces have stronger phonon–phonon coupling than the C–N matched interfaces, which results in significantly higher TBC (more than 50\%) in the C–B matched interface. The findings in this study will provide insights to understand the mechanism of phonon transport at h-BN/graphene/h-BN interfaces, to better explain the experimental observations and to engineer these interfaces to enhance heat dissipation in graphene based electronic devices.},

In this review, we outline different experimental techniques and theoretical approaches for phonon thermal transport in 2D materials, discuss the problems and challenges of phonon thermal transport measurements and provide a comparison between existing experimental data.

	abstract = {Two prototype transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials, MoS2 and MoSe2, have attracted growing attention as promising 2D semiconductors. The heterostructure created by stacking the 2D monolayers in the out-of-plane direction exhibits peculiar properties that can be utilized in electronic applications. The lateral and ﬂexural phonon transport behaviors in MoS2/MoSe2 heterobilayer are comprehensively investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations. In-plane thermal conductivity (κ) and out-of-plane interfacial thermal resistance (R) are calculated by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) and transient pump−probe methods, respectively. Thermal conductivity of MoS2/MoSe2 bilayer 2D sheet is characterized as 28.8 W/m·K, which preserves the high thermal conductivity of most TMDC materials. The maximum κ reductions of MoS2, MoSe2, and heterobilayer amount to 83.0, 68.9, and 77.1\%, respectively, with increasing temperatures from 100 to 500 K. It is also found that the basal-plane thermal performance of MoS2/MoSe2 bilayer will not be aﬀected by interfacial interactions, which is important in industrial applications. The predicted out-of-plane ﬂexural phonon conductance results reveal that heat ﬂux runs preferably from MoS2 to MoSe2 than in the reverse direction.},

While unusually rapid and eﬃcient transfer of photoexcitation energy to atomic vibrations was found in recent experiments, its electronic origin remains unknown. Here, we study the lattice dynamics induced by electronic excitation in a model TMDC monolayer, MoSe2, using nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics simulations. Simulation results show subpicosecond disordering of the lattice upon photoexcitation, as measured by the Debye−Waller factor, as well as increasing disorder for higher densities of photogenerated electron−hole pairs. Detailed analysis shows that the rapid, photoinduced lattice dynamics are due to phonon-mode softening, which in turn arises from electronic Fermi surface nesting. Such mechanistic understanding can help guide optical control of material properties for functionalizing TMDC layers, enabling emerging applications such as phase change memories and neuromorphic computing.},

Here, we combine femtosecond mega-electronvolt electron diﬀraction experiments on a prototypical layered material, MoTe2, with non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio electronic structure calculations to show how non-radiative energy relaxation pathways for excited electrons can be tuned by controlling the optical excitation energy. We show how the dominant intravalley and intervalley scattering mechanisms for hot and band-edge electrons leads to markedly diﬀerent transient phonon populations evident in electron diﬀraction patterns. This understanding of how tuning optical excitations aﬀect phonon populations and atomic motion is critical for eﬃciently controlling light-induced structural transitions of optoelectronic devices.},

This nonthermal state is characterized by a modiﬁed anisotropy of the atomic vibrations compared to equilibrium.

Reproduction of measurements clariﬁed that the photon energy relaxation depends on the response of bond energy to thermal excitation, and the phonon frequency varies with the bond stiﬀnessa function of length and energy. Besides, theoretical matching to experimental observations has derived the Debye temperatures of the speciﬁcally layered nanostructures and the atomic cohesive energy of their bulk counterparts as well.

These dynamic energy conversion processes have been commonly studied by transient optical probes to date, but an understanding of the atomistic response following photoexcitation has remained elusive. Here, we use femtosecond resolution electron diﬀraction to investigate transient lattice responses in optically excited colloidal gold nanocrystals, revealing the eﬀects of nanocrystal size and surface ligands on the electron−phonon coupling and thermal relaxation dynamics. First, we uncover a strong size eﬀect on the electron−phonon coupling, which arises from reduced dielectric screening at the nanocrystal surfaces and prevails independent of the optical excitation mechanism (i.e., inter- and intraband). Second, we ﬁnd that surface ligands act as a tuning parameter for hot carrier cooling. Particularly, gold nanocrystals with thiol-based ligands show signiﬁcantly slower carrier cooling as compared to amine-based ligands under intraband optical excitation due to electronic coupling at the nanocrystal/ ligand interfaces. Finally, we spatiotemporally resolve thermal transport and heat dissipation in photoexcited nanocrystal ﬁlms by combining electron diﬀraction with stroboscopic elastic scattering microscopy. Taken together, we resolve the distinct thermal relaxation time scales ranging from 1 ps to 100 ns associated with the multiple interfaces through which heat ﬂows at the nanoscale.

            Nonradiative processes limit optoelectronic functionality of nanocrystals and curb their device performance. Nevertheless, the dynamic structural origins of nonradiative relaxations in such materials are not understood. Here, femtosecond electron diffraction measurements corroborated by atomistic simulations uncover transient lattice deformations accompanying radiationless electronic processes in colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. Investigation of the excitation energy dependence in a core/shell system shows that hot carriers created by a photon energy considerably larger than the bandgap induce structural distortions at nanocrystal surfaces on few picosecond timescales associated with the localization of trapped holes. On the other hand, carriers created by a photon energy close to the bandgap of the core in the same system result in transient lattice heating that occurs on a much longer 200 picosecond timescale, dominated by an Auger heating mechanism. Elucidation of the structural deformations associated with the surface trapping of hot holes provides atomic-scale insights into the mechanisms deteriorating optoelectronic performance and a pathway towards minimizing these losses in nanocrystal devices.},

These applications include studies of isolated chemical reactions (molecular beams), interfaces, surfaces and nanocrystals, self-assembly, and 2D crystalline fatty-acid bilayers. In 4D UEM, we are now able, using timed, single-electron packets, to image nano-to-micro scale structures of materials and biological cells.

            Synchrotron X-ray tomography enables the examination of the internal structure of materials at submicron spatial resolution and subsecond temporal resolution. Unavoidable experimental constraints can impose dose and time limits on the measurements, introducing noise in the reconstructed images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to remove noise from reconstructed images. However, their training typically requires collecting a dataset of paired noisy and high-quality measurements, which is a major obstacle to their use in practice. To circumvent this problem, methods for CNN-based denoising have recently been proposed that require no separate training data beyond the already available noisy reconstructions. Among these, the Noise2Inverse method is specifically designed for tomography and related inverse problems. To date, applications of Noise2Inverse have only taken into account 2D spatial information. In this paper, we expand the application of Noise2Inverse in space, time, and spectrum-like domains. This development enhances applications to static and dynamic micro-tomography as well as X-ray diffraction tomography. Results on real-world datasets establish that Noise2Inverse is capable of accurate denoising and enables a substantial reduction in acquisition time while maintaining image quality.},

            Machine learning advances chemistry and materials science by enabling large-scale exploration of chemical space based on quantum chemical calculations. While these models supply fast and accurate predictions of atomistic chemical properties, they do not explicitly capture the electronic degrees of freedom of a molecule, which limits their applicability for reactive chemistry and chemical analysis. Here we present a deep learning framework for the prediction of the quantum mechanical wavefunction in a local basis of atomic orbitals from which all other ground-state properties can be derived. This approach retains full access to the electronic structure via the wavefunction at force-field-like efficiency and captures quantum mechanics in an analytically differentiable representation. On several examples, we demonstrate that this opens promising avenues to perform inverse design of molecular structures for targeting electronic property optimisation and a clear path towards increased synergy of machine learning and quantum chemistry.},

              Ultrafast diffraction imaging is a powerful tool to retrieve the geometric structure of gas-phase molecules with combined picometre spatial and attosecond temporal resolution. However, structural retrieval becomes progressively difficult with increasing structural complexity, given that a global extremum must be found in a multi-dimensional solution space. Worse, pre-calculating many thousands of molecular configurations for all orientations becomes simply intractable. As a remedy, here, we propose a machine learning algorithm with a convolutional neural network which can be trained with a limited set of molecular configurations. We demonstrate structural retrieval of a complex and large molecule, Fenchone (C

              Graphene based van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) have gained substantial interest recently due to their unique electrical and optical characteristics as well as unprecedented opportunities to explore new physics and revolutionary design of nanodevices. However, the heat conduction performance of these vdWHs holds a crucial role in deciding their functional efficiency. In-plane and out-of-plane thermal conduction phenomena in graphene/2D-SiC vdWHs were studied using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and the transient pump-probe technique, respectively. At room temperature, we determined an in-plane thermal conductivity of {\textasciitilde} 1452 W/m-K for an infinite length graphene/2D-SiC vdWH, which is superior to any graphene based vdWHs reported yet. The out-of-plane thermal resistance of graphene → 2D-SiC and 2D-SiC → graphene was estimated to be 2.71 × 10

The phonon-mediated both in-plane and out-of-plane heat transfer is clarified for this prospective heterobilayer.

These findings are useful in explaining the heat conduction at the interfaces in graphene/2D-SiC vdWH and may provide a guideline for efficient design and regulation of their thermal characteristics.},

It is commonly associated with a number of fundamental and complex processes such as intraband relaxation, energy transfer, and light harvesting inﬂuenced by the spatial evolution of excitations and transformation of photoexcitation energy into electrical energy via charge separation (e.g., charge injection at interfaces). To treat ultrafast excited-state dynamics and exciton/charge transport we have developed a nonadiabatic excited-state molecular dynamics (NA-ESMD) framework incorporating quantum transitions. Our calculations rely on the use of the Collective Electronic Oscillator (CEO) package accounting for many-body eﬀects and actual potential energy surfaces of the excited states combined with Tully's fewest switches algorithm for surface hopping for probing nonadiabatic processes. This method is applied to model the photoinduced dynamics of distyrylbenzene (a small oligomer of polyphenylene vinylene, PPV). Our analysis shows intricate details of photoinduced vibronic relaxation and identiﬁes speciﬁc slow and fast nuclear motions that are strongly coupled to the electronic degrees of freedom, namely, torsion and bond length alternation, respectively. Nonadiabatic relaxation of the highly excited mAg state is predicted to occur on a femtosecond time scale at room temperature and on a picosecond time scale at low temperature.},

A wide range of materials are covered in this review, including twodimensional materials, superhard materials, metamaterials, and polymers. We also cover the very recent important findings on heat transfer mechanisms informed from first principles, including phonon–electron scattering, higher-order phonon–phonon scattering, and the effect of external electric field on thermal transport.

Here, we directly visualize the dynamics of these processes within monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 using femtosecond electron scattering techniques as a real-time probe with atomic-scale resolution. We show that optical excitation induces large-amplitude in-plane displacements and ultrafast wrinkling of the monolayer on nanometer length-scales, developing on picosecond time-scales. These deformations are associated with several percent peak strains that are fully reversible over tens of millions of cycles. Direct measurements of electron−phonon coupling times and the subsequent interfacial thermal heat ﬂow between the monolayer and substrate are also obtained. These measurements, coupled with ﬁrst-principles modeling, provide a new understanding of the dynamic structural processes that underlie the functionality of two-dimensional materials and open up new opportunities for ultrafast strain engineering using all-optical methods.},

          , 
            Two-dimensional materials from layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals hold great promise for electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices, but technological implementation will be hampered by the lack of high-throughput techniques for exfoliating single-crystal monolayers with sufficient size and high quality. Here, we report a facile method to disassemble vdW single crystals layer by layer into monolayers with near-unity yield and with dimensions limited only by bulk crystal sizes. The macroscopic monolayers are comparable in quality to microscopic monolayers from conventional Scotch tape exfoliation. The monolayers can be assembled into macroscopic artificial structures, including transition metal dichalcogenide multilayers with broken inversion symmetry and substantially enhanced nonlinear optical response. This approach takes us one step closer to mass production of macroscopic monolayers and bulk-like artificial materials with controllable properties.},

	abstract = {Unique twisted bilayers of MoSe2 with multiple stacking orientations and interlayer couplings in the narrow range of twist angles, 60 ± 3°, are revealed by low-frequency Raman spectroscopy and theoretical analysis. The slight deviation from 60° allows the concomitant presence of patches featuring all three high-symmetry stacking conﬁgurations (2H or AA′, AB′, and A′B) in one unique bilayer system. In this case, the periodic arrangement of the patches and their size strongly depend on the twist angle. Ab initio modeling predicts signiﬁcant changes in frequencies and intensities of low-frequency modes versus stacking and twist angle. Experimentally, the variable stacking and coupling across the interface are revealed by the appearance of two breathing modes, corresponding to the mixture of the high-symmetry stacking conﬁgurations and unaligned regions of monolayers. Only one breathing mode is observed outside the narrow range of twist angles. This indicates a stacking transition to unaligned monolayers with mismatched atom registry without the in-plane restoring force required to generate a shear mode. The variable interlayer coupling and spacing in transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers revealed in this study may provide an interesting platform for optoelectronic applications of these materials.},

Harnessing photoexcited HCs offers the potential to exceed the thermodynamic limit of power conversion efficiency, although major loss channels employing ultrafast thermalization of HCs severely restrict their utilization in conventional bulk-a bsorber-b ased solar cells. Spatially confined semiconductors, especially 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials, offer several advantages, such as strong Coulomb interaction, high exciton binding energy, strong carrier–carrier scattering and weak carrier–phonon coupling, resulting in slow HC cooling and restricted loss channels. This Review provides a detailed mechanistic understanding of the HC cooling dynamics in confined vdW layered materials for efficiently utilizing HCs and discusses the role of carrier multiplication in designing a solar cell with the power conversion efficiency exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit. Additionally, we analyse the major energy loss channels that limit the efficiency of a conventional solar cell, as well as the promises held by the 2D vdW heterostructures for an efficient HC solar cell. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges and opportunities involved in successfully utilizing HCs in practical solar cells with efficiencies beyond the thermodynamic limit.},

Such a concept has already proven fruitful for a number of electronic applications in the area of ultrathin and flexible devices. Here, we expand the range of such structures to photoactive ones by using semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)/graphene stacks. Van Hove singularities in the electronic density of states of TMDC guarantees enhanced light-matter interactions, leading to enhanced photon absorption and electron-hole creation (which are collected in transparent graphene electrodes). This allows development of extremely efficient flexible photovoltaic devices with photoresponsivity above 0.1 ampere per watt (corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of above 30\%).},

Photoinduced nonequilibrium carrier and lattice dynamics in such heterostructures underlie these applications but have not been understood. In particular, the dependence of these photoresponses on the twist angle, a key tuning parameter, remains elusive. Here, using ultrafast electron diﬀraction, we report the simultaneous visualization of charge transfer and electron−phonon coupling in MoS2-graphene heterostructures with diﬀerent stacking conﬁgurations. We ﬁnd that the charge transfer timescale from MoS2 to graphene varies strongly with twist angle, becoming faster for smaller twist angles, and show that the relaxation timescale is signiﬁcantly shorter in a heterostructure as compared to a monolayer. These ﬁndings illustrate that twist angle constitutes an additional tuning knob for interlayer charge transfer in heterobilayers and deepen our understanding of fundamental photophysical processes in heterostructures, of importance for future applications in optoelectronics and light harvesting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
              Materials by design is an appealing idea that is very hard to realize in practice. Combining the best of different ingredients in one ultimate material is a task for which we currently have no general solution. However, we do have some successful examples to draw upon: Composite materials and III-V heterostructures have revolutionized many aspects of our lives. Still, we need a general strategy to solve the problem of mixing and matching crystals with different properties, creating combinations with predetermined attributes and functionalities.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              
                Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a platform that allows creation of heterostructures with a variety of properties. One-atom-thick crystals now comprise a large family of these materials, collectively covering a very broad range of properties. The first material to be included was graphene, a zero-overlap semimetal. The family of 2D crystals has grown to includes metals (e.g., NbSe
                2
                ), semiconductors (e.g., MoS
                2
                ), and insulators [e.g., hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)]. Many of these materials are stable at ambient conditions, and we have come up with strategies for handling those that are not. Surprisingly, the properties of such 2D materials are often very different from those of their 3D counterparts. Furthermore, even the study of familiar phenomena (like superconductivity or ferromagnetism) in the 2D case, where there is no long-range order, raises many thought-provoking questions.
              
              A plethora of opportunities appear when we start to combine several 2D crystals in one vertical stack. Held together by van der Waals forces (the same forces that hold layered materials together), such heterostructures allow a far greater number of combinations than any traditional growth method. As the family of 2D crystals is expanding day by day, so too is the complexity of the heterostructures that could be created with atomic precision.
              When stacking different crystals together, the synergetic effects become very important. In the first-order approximation, charge redistribution might occur between the neighboring (and even more distant) crystals in the stack. Neighboring crystals can also induce structural changes in each other. Furthermore, such changes can be controlled by adjusting the relative orientation between the individual elements.
              Such heterostructures have already led to the observation of numerous exciting physical phenomena. Thus, spectrum reconstruction in graphene interacting with hBN allowed several groups to study the Hofstadter butterfly effect and topological currents in such a system. The possibility of positioning crystals in very close (but controlled) proximity to one another allows for the study of tunneling and drag effects. The use of semiconducting monolayers leads to the creation of optically active heterostructures.
              The extended range of functionalities of such heterostructures yields a range of possible applications. Now the highest-mobility graphene transistors are achieved by encapsulating graphene with hBN. Photovoltaic and light-emitting devices have been demonstrated by combining optically active semiconducting layers and graphene as transparent electrodes.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              Currently, most 2D heterostructures are composed by direct stacking of individual monolayer flakes of different materials. Although this method allows ultimate flexibility, it is slow and cumbersome. Thus, techniques involving transfer of large-area crystals grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), direct growth of heterostructures by CVD or physical epitaxy, or one-step growth in solution are being developed. Currently, we are at the same level as we were with graphene 10 years ago: plenty of interesting science and unclear prospects for mass production. Given the fast progress of graphene technology over the past few years, we can expect similar advances in the production of the heterostructures, making the science and applications more achievable.
              
                
                  Production of van der Waals heterostructures.
                  
                    Owing to a large number of 2D crystals available today, many functional van der Waals heterostructures can be created. What started with mechanically assembled stacks (
                    top
                    ) has now evolved to large-scale growth by CVD or physical epitaxy (
                    bottom
                    ).
                  
                
                
              
            
          , 
            The physics of two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures based on such crystals has been developing extremely fast. With these new materials, truly 2D physics has begun to appear (for instance, the absence of long-range order, 2D excitons, commensurate-incommensurate transition, etc.). Novel heterostructure devices—such as tunneling transistors, resonant tunneling diodes, and light-emitting diodes—are also starting to emerge. Composed from individual 2D crystals, such devices use the properties of those materials to create functionalities that are not accessible in other heterostructures. Here we review the properties of novel 2D crystals and examine how their properties are used in new heterostructure devices.},

This makes it feasible to isolate, mix and match highly disparate atomic layers to create a wide range of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) without the constraints of lattice matching and processing compatibility. Exploiting the novel properties in these vdWHs with diverse layering of metals, semiconductors or insulators, new designs of electronic devices emerge, including tunnelling transistors, barristors and flexible electronics, as well as optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors, photovoltaics and light-emitting devices with unprecedented characteristics or unique functionalities. We review the recent progress and challenges, and offer our perspective on the exploration of 2DLM‑based vdWHs for future application in electronics and optoelectronics.},

However, these applications require dissociation of strongly bound photogenerated excitons. The dissociation can be achieved by vertically stacking diﬀerent monolayers to realize band alignment that favors interlayer charge transfer. In such heterostructures, the reported recombination times vary strongly, and the charge separation and recombination mechanisms remain elusive. We use two color pump−probe microscopy to demonstrate that the charge separation in a MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure is ultrafast (∼200 fs) and virtually temperature independent, whereas the recombination accelerates strongly with temperature. Ab initio quantum dynamics simulations rationalize the experiments, indicating that the charge separation is temperature-independent because it is barrierless, involves dense acceptor states, and is promoted by higher-frequency out-of-plane vibrations. The strong temperature dependence of the recombination, on the other hand, arises from a transient indirect-to-direct bandgap modulation by low-frequency shear and layer breathing motions.},

The charge transfer rate is very robust in transition metal disulﬁde (TMD) heterostructures with type II band alignments, which can be manipulated by intercalating a dielectric layer like hBN to isolate the donor and acceptor monolayers. This study shows that there is an alternative way to change the electron transfer and recombination rates in the case of nLMoS2/mLWSe2 multilayer heterostructures, where the donor−acceptor distance is maintained, but the rate of electron transfer is strongly layer dependent and shows asymmetry for the layer number of donor and acceptor monolayers. Especially, the 1LMoS2/2LWSe2 heterostructure slows electron transfer and charge recombination rates ∼2.3 and ∼12 times that of the 1LMoS2/1LWSe2 heterostructure, respectively, which have been competitive with that in the 1LMoS2/hBN/1LWSe2 heterostructure. From an application perspective, the noninterfacial electron transfer in which photogenerated electrons should across more than one atomically thin layer is not favorable due to the built-in electric ﬁeld established by the initial interfacial electron transfer.},

	abstract = {Interfacial charge separation and recombination at heterojunctions of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are of interest to two-dimensional optoelectronic technologies. These processes can involve large changes in parallel momentum vector due to the conﬁnement of electrons and holes to the K valleys in each layer. Because these high-momentum valleys are usually not aligned across the interface of two TMDC monolayers, how parallel momentum is conserved in the charge separation or recombination process becomes a key question. Here we probe this question using the model system of a type-II heterojunction formed by MoS2 and WSe2 monolayers and the experimental technique of femtosecond pump−probe spectroscopy. Upon photoexcitation speciﬁcally of WSe2 at the heterojunction, we observe ultrafast ({\textless}40 fs) electron transfer from WSe2 to MoS2, independent of the angular alignment and thus momentum mismatch between the two TMDCs. The resulting interlayer charge transfer exciton decays via nonradiative recombination with rates varying by up to three-orders of magnitude from sample to sample but with no correlation with interlayer angular alignment. We suggest that the initial interfacial charge separation and the subsequent interfacial charge recombination processes circumvent momentum mismatch via excess electronic energy and via defect-mediated recombination, respectively.},

The interlayer coupling strongly inﬂuences the band structure of the heterostructures, resulting in novel properties that can be utilized for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Based on microwave microscopy studies, we report quantitative electrical imaging on gated molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2)/tungsten diselenide (WSe2) heterostructure devices, which exhibit an intriguing antiambipolar eﬀect in their transfer characteristics. Interestingly, in the region with signiﬁcant source-drain current, electrons in the n-type MoS2 and holes in the p-type WSe2 segments are nearly balanced, whereas the heterostructure area is depleted of mobile charges. The spatial evolution of local conductance can be ascribed to the lateral band bending and formation of depletion regions along the line of MoS2− heterostructure−WSe2. Our work vividly demonstrates the microscopic origin of novel transport behaviors, which is important for the vibrant ﬁeld of vdW heterojunction research.},

This thermal boundary conductance across solid interfaces at the nanoscale can affect a plethora of applications. The recent experimental and computational advances that have led to significant atomistic insights into the nanoscopic thermal transport mechanisms at interfaces between various types of materials are summarized. The authors focus on discussions of works that have pushed the limits to interfacial heat transfer and drastically increased the understanding of thermal boundary conductance on the atomic and nanometer scales near solid/solid interfaces. Specifically, the role of localized interfacial modes on the energy conversion processes occurring at interfaces is emphasized in this review. The authors also focus on experiments and computational works that have challenged the traditionally used phonon gas models in interpreting the physical mechanisms driving interfacial energy transport. Finally, the authors discuss the future directions and avenues of research that can further the knowledge of heat transfer across systems with broken symmetries.},

              We apply variational autoencoders (VAE) to X-ray diffraction (XRD) data analysis on both simulated and experimental thin-film data. We show that crystal structure representations learned by a VAE reveal latent information, such as the structural similarity of textured diffraction patterns. While other artificial intelligence (AI) agents are effective at classifying XRD data into known phases, a similarly conditioned VAE is uniquely effective at knowing what it doesn’t know: it can rapidly identify data outside the distribution it was trained on, such as novel phases and mixtures. These capabilities demonstrate that a VAE is a valuable AI agent for aiding materials discovery and understanding XRD measurements both ‘on-the-fly’ and during

These techniques play critical roles in understanding a wide variety of materials systems from catalysts to polymers, nanomaterials to macromolecules, and energy materials to quantum materials. In recent years, neutron and x-ray scattering have received a signiﬁcant boost due to the development and increased application of machine learning to materials problems. This article reviews the recent progress in applying machine learning techniques to augment various neutron and x-ray techniques, including neutron scattering, x-ray absorption, x-ray scattering, and photoemission. We highlight the integration of machine learning methods into the typical workﬂow of scattering experiments, focusing on problems that challenge traditional analysis approaches but are addressable through machine learning, including leveraging the knowledge of simple materials to model more complicated systems, learning with limited data or incomplete labels, identifying meaningful spectra and materials representations, mitigating spectral noise, and others. We present an outlook on a few emerging roles machine learning may play in broad types of scattering and spectroscopic problems in the foreseeable future.},

Here we report the temperature-dependent thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of monolayer MoS2 with AlN and SiO2, using Raman thermometry with laser-induced heating. The temperature-dependent optical absorption of the 2D material is crucial in such experiments, which we characterize here for the ﬁrst time above room temperature. We obtain TBC ∼ 15 MW m−2 K−1 near room temperature, increasing as ∼ T0.65 in the range 300−600 K. The similar TBC of MoS2 with the two substrates indicates that MoS2 is the “softer” material with weaker phonon irradiance, and the relatively low TBC signiﬁes that such interfaces present a key bottleneck in energy dissipation from 2D devices. Our approach is needed to correctly perform Raman thermometry of 2D materials, and our ﬁndings are key for understanding energy coupling at the nanoscale.},

	abstract = {Understanding energy dissipation and transport in nanoscale structures is of great importance for the design of energy-efficient circuits and energy-conversion systems. This is also a rich domain for fundamental discoveries at the intersection of electron, lattice (phonon), and optical (photon) interactions. This review presents recent progress in understanding and manipulation of energy dissipation and transport in nanoscale solid-state structures. First, the landscape of power usage from nanoscale transistors ({\textasciitilde}10–8 W) to massive data centers ({\textasciitilde}109 W) is surveyed. Then, focus is given to energy dissipation in nanoscale circuits, silicon transistors, carbon nanostructures, and semiconductor nanowires. Concepts of steady-state and transient thermal transport are also reviewed in the context of nanoscale devices with sub-nanosecond switching times. Finally, recent directions regarding energy transport are reviewed, including electrical and thermal conductivity of nanostructures, thermal rectification, and the role of ubiquitous material interfaces.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have attracted interest as a conductor/insulator pair in next-generation devices because of their unique physical properties; however, the thermal transport at the interfaces must be understood to accurately predict the performance of heterostructures composed of these materials. Time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) is used to estimate the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) at the interface of h-BN and graphene to be 34.5 (+11.6/−7.4) MW m−2 K−1. The advantage of TDTR is that it does not need to create a large temperature gradient at the interface of heterostructures, but it has not yet been used for h-BN/graphene interface. Phonon transmission and TBC at the h-BN/graphene interface are predicted by two different formulations of the diffuse mismatch model (DMM) for anisotropic materials. The analysis of phonon transmission and temperature dependence of TBC establishes the flexural branch in the ab-plane, and the c-plane longitudinal acoustic branch of graphene and h-BN are the dominant contributors when implementing both the DMM models. The methodology developed herein can be used to analyze heterostructures of other 2D materials.},

The transfer occurs through the intercalation of a layer of water between a hydrophilic substrate and a hydrophobic nanostructure (for example, graphene ﬂakes, carbon nanotubes, metallic nanostructures, quantum dots, etc.) locked within a hydrophobic polymer thin ﬁlm. As a result, the ﬁlm entrapping the nanostructure is lifted off and ﬂoats at the air-water interface. The nanostructure can subsequently be deposited onto a target substrate by the removal of the water and the dissolution of the polymeric ﬁlm. We show examples where graphene ﬂakes and patterned metallic nanostructures are precisely transferred onto a speciﬁc location on a variety of patterned substrates, even on top of curved objects such as microspheres. The method is simple to use, fast, and does not require advanced equipment.},

This article explores the recent ML work undertaken at Oak Ridge National Laboratory involving neutron scattering data. We cover materials structure modeling for diffuse scattering, powder diffraction, and small-angle scattering. We also discuss how ML can help to model the response of the instrument more precisely, as well as enable quick extraction of information from neutron data.

	abstract = {Interlayer excitons, electron-hole pairs bound across two monolayer van der Waals semiconductors, offer promising electrical tunability and localizability. Because such excitons display weak electron-hole overlap, most studies have examined only the lowest-energy excitons through photoluminescence. We directly measured the dielectric response of interlayer excitons, which we accessed using their static electric dipole moment. We thereby determined an intrinsic radiative lifetime of 0.40 nanoseconds for the lowest direct-gap interlayer exciton in a tungsten diselenide/molybdenum diselenide heterostructure. We found that differences in electric field and twist angle induced trends in exciton transition strengths and energies, which could be related to wave function overlap, moiré confinement, and atomic reconstruction. Through comparison with photoluminescence spectra, this study identifies a momentum-indirect emission mechanism. Characterization of the absorption is key for applications relying on light-matter interactions.

The combination of flat dispersion and uniformity of Berry curvature near the magic angle holds promise for realizing fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect at fractional filling.

	abstract = {Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, allow the fabrication of multilayer structures without lattice matching restriction. A central issue in developing such artiﬁcial materials is to understand and control the interlayer electron transfer process, which plays a key role in harnessing their emergent properties. Recent photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements revealed that the electron transfer in heterobilayers occurs on ultrafast time scales. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding on how this process can be so eﬃcient at van der Waals interfaces. Here we show evidence suggesting the coherent nature of such interlayer electron transfer. In a trilayer of MoS2−WS2−MoSe2, electrons excited in MoSe2 transfer to MoS2 in about one picosecond. Surprisingly, these electrons do not populate the middle WS2 layer during this process. Calculations showed the coherent nature of the charge transfer and reproduced the measured electron transfer time. The hole transfer from MoS2 to MoSe2 is also found to be eﬃcient and ultrafast. The separation of electrons and holes extends their lifetimes to more than one nanosecond, suggesting potential applications of such multilayer structures in optoelectronics.},

Five measurement methods are then compared in terms of their sensitivity to TBC: the 3ω method, frequency- and time-domain thermoreflectance, the cut-bar method, and a composite effective thermal conductivity method. The heart of the review surveys 30 years of TBC measurements around room temperature, highlighting the materials science factors experimentally proven to influence TBC. These factors include the bulk dispersion relations, acoustic contrast, and interfacial chemistry and bonding. The measured TBCs are compared across a wide range of materials systems by using the maximum transmission limit, which with an attenuated transmission coefficient proves to be a good guideline for most clean, strongly bonded interfaces. Finally, opportunities for future research are discussed.},

Photoluminescence spectra and Raman spectra show that the interlayer coupling is sensitive to twist angle. In the bilayer WS2 with a twist angle of 0 or 60°, the interlayer coupling strength is the strongest. However, when the twist angle is between 0 and 60°, interlayer coupling strength becomes much weaker and reaches a minimum around 30°. Combined with density functional theory calculation, the modulation of interlayer coupling originates from the change of the interlayer distance due to repulsion between two adjacent WS2 layers. It is observed that spin−orbital coupling (SOC) and interlayer coupling induced spin splitting as large as 400 meV.},

              We apply variational autoencoders (VAE) to X-ray diffraction (XRD) data analysis on both simulated and experimental thin-film data. We show that crystal structure representations learned by a VAE reveal latent information, such as the structural similarity of textured diffraction patterns. While other artificial intelligence (AI) agents are effective at classifying XRD data into known phases, a similarly conditioned VAE is uniquely effective at knowing what it doesn’t know: it can rapidly identify data outside the distribution it was trained on, such as novel phases and mixtures. These capabilities demonstrate that a VAE is a valuable AI agent for aiding materials discovery and understanding XRD measurements both ‘on-the-fly’ and during

For a wide variety of compounds, the majority of studies are limited by observations at ﬁxed temperature and composition, in which case, relevant information can be determined only from the behaviors at topological and structural defects. All analyses to date utilize macroscopic descriptors derived from structural information such as polarization or octahedral tilts extracted from the atomic positions, ignoring the multiple degrees of freedom observable from atomically resolved images. In this article, we provide a solution, by exploring the mechanisms of a phase transition between the trigonal prismatic and distorted octahedral phases of layered chalcogenides in the 2D MoS2–ReS2 system from the observations of local degrees of freedom, namely atomic positions by scanning transmission electron microscopy. We employ local crystallographic analysis based on statistical learning of atomic environments to build a picture of the transition from the atomic level up and determine local and global variables controlling the local symmetry breaking. We highlight how the dependence of the average symmetry-breaking distortion amplitude on global and local concentration can be used to separate local chemical as well as global electronic effects on the transition. This approach allows for the exploring of atomic mechanisms beyond the traditional macroscopic descriptions, utilizing the imaging of compositional ﬂuctuations in solids to explore phase transitions over a range of observed local stoichiometries and atomic conﬁgurations.},

This approach is predicated on the synergy of two concepts, the parsimony of physical descriptors and general rotational invariance of noncrystalline solids, and is implemented using a rotationally invariant extension of the variational autoencoder applied to semantically segmented atom-resolved data seeking the most effective reduced representation for the system that still contains the maximum amount of original information. This approach allowed us to explore the dynamic evolution of electron beam–induced processes in a silicon-doped graphene system, but it can be also applied for a much broader range of atomic scale and mesoscopic phenomena to introduce the bottom-up order parameters and explore their dynamics with time and in response to external stimuli.},

However, this method is inherently unstable when the local landscape is complicated or the signal-to-noise ratio of the data is low. In this work, we propose a new method in which the peak tracking task is formalized as an inverse problem, which thus can be solved with a convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition, we show that the underlying physics principle of the experiments can be used to generate the training data. By generalizing the trained neural network on real experimental data, we show that the CNN method can achieve comparable or better results than traditional derivative based methods. This approach can be further generalized in different physics experiments when the physical process is known.},

In such a case, the limited time available for data acquisition can be a serious constraint for experiments in which multidimensional spectral data are acquired. Here, taking angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) as an example, we demonstrate a denoising method that utilizes deep learning as an intelligent way to overcome the constraint. With readily available ARPES data and random generation of training datasets, we successfully trained the denoising neural network without overfitting. The denoising neural network can remove the noise in the data while preserving its intrinsic information. We show that the denoising neural network allows us to perform a similar level of second-derivative and line shape analysis on data taken with two orders of magnitude less acquisition time. The importance of our method lies in its applicability to any multidimensional spectral data that are susceptible to statistical noise.},

One such technique is femtosecond electron microdiffraction, in which a short electron pulse with femtosecond-scale duration is focused into a micron-scale spot and used to obtain diffraction images to resolve ultrafast structural dynamics over a localized crystalline domain. In this letter, we report the experimental demonstration of time-resolved mega-electron-volt electron microdiffraction which achieves a 5 μm root-mean-square (rms) beam size on the sample and a 110 fs rms temporal resolution. Using pulses of 10k electrons at 4.2 MeV energy with a normalized emittance 3 nm-rad, we obtained high quality diffraction from a single 10 μm paraffin (C44H90) crystal. The phonon softening mode in optical-pumped polycrystalline Bi was also time-resolved, demonstrating the temporal resolution limits of the instrument. This new characterization capability will open many research opportunities in material and biological sciences.},

In particular, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is presented which yields a promising result in that it correctly identifies the space group among the top-6 estimates 91.9\% of the time.

	abstract = {Constitutive laws underlie most physical processes in nature. However, learning such equations in heterogeneous solids (for example, due to phase separation) is challenging. One such relationship is between composition and eigenstrain, which governs the chemo-mechanical expansion in solids. Here we developed a generalizable, physically constrained image-learning framework to algorithmically learn the chemo-mechanical constitutive law at the nanoscale from correlative four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray spectro-ptychography images. We demonstrated this approach on LiXFePO4, a technologically relevant battery positive electrode material. We uncovered the functional form of the composition–eigenstrain relation in this two-phase binary solid across the entire composition range (0 ≤ X ≤ 1), including inside the thermodynamically unstable miscibility gap. The learned relation directly validates Vegard’s law of linear response at the nanoscale. Our physics-constrained data-driven approach directly visualizes the residual strain field (by removing the compositional and coherency strain), which is otherwise impossible to quantify. Heterogeneities in the residual strain arise from misfit dislocations and were independently verified by X-ray diffraction line profile analysis. Our work provides the means to simultaneously quantify chemical expansion, coherency strain and dislocations in battery electrodes, which has implications on rate capabilities and lifetime. Broadly, this work also highlights the potential of integrating correlative microscopy and image learning for extracting material properties and physics.},

	abstract = {We propose a general framework for denoising high-dimensional measurements which requires no prior on the signal, no estimate of the noise, and no clean training data. The only assumption is that the noise exhibits statistical independence across different dimensions of the measurement, while the true signal exhibits some correlation. For a broad class of functions ("\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{J\}\$-invariant"), it is then possible to estimate the performance of a denoiser from noisy data alone. This allows us to calibrate \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{J\}\$-invariant versions of any parameterised denoising algorithm, from the single hyperparameter of a median filter to the millions of weights of a deep neural network. We demonstrate this on natural image and microscopy data, where we exploit noise independence between pixels, and on single-cell gene expression data, where we exploit independence between detections of individual molecules. This framework generalizes recent work on training neural nets from noisy images and on cross-validation for matrix factorization.},

Material properties are systematically calculated by state-of-the-art density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory (G0W0 and the Bethe–Salpeter equation for  ∼250 materials) following a semiautomated workflow for maximal consistency and transparency. The C2DB is fully open and can be browsed online (http://c2db.fysik.dtu.dk) or downloaded in its entirety. In this paper, we describe the workflow behind the database, present an overview of the properties and materials currently available, and explore trends and correlations in the data. Moreover, we identify a large number of new potentially synthesisable 2D materials with interesting properties targeting applications within spintronics, (opto-)electronics, and plasmonics. The C2DB offers a comprehensive and easily accessible overview of the rapidly expanding family of 2D materials and forms an ideal platform for computational modeling and design of new 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures.},

	abstract = {Although the thermal conductivities of MoS2 and WS2 have been reported by some experimental and theoretical studies, the results are inconsistent. Here, thermal transport properties of twelve types of single layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX2 (M=Cr, Mo, W; X=O, S, Se, Te) are investigated systematically, by solving Boltzmann transport equation based on first-principle calculations. After accurate considering the size effect and boundary scattering, we find that our calculations can fit the experimental results very well. Moreover, diverse transport properties in TMDs are revealed, and an abnormal dependence of thermal conductivity on atomic mass is observed. In most MX2 structures, the thermal conductivities decrease with the increase of mass of atom M or X. However, the thermal conductivities of sulfides MS2 and selenides MSe2 increase as the M changes from Cr to Mo to W, which is contradictory to our traditional understanding. A detailed calculation indicates that the abnormal trend is originated from the rapid increase of phonon relaxation time. Our studies provide important information for thermal transport abilities in TMDs.},

	abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.
Program Summary
Program Title: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/cxbxs9btsv.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/lammps/lammps Licensing provisions: GPLv2 Programming language: C++, Python, C, Fortran Supplementary material: https://www.lammps.org Nature of problem: Many science applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and related fields require parallel, scalable, and efficient generation of long, stable classical particle dynamics trajectories. Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Størmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the LAMMPS code.

Monolayer ﬂakes of MoTe2, WS2, and MoS2 are obtained by mechanical exfoliation from their bulk crystals and are used to fabricate the heterostructures by a dry-transfer technique. Photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements indicate that the recombination of the MoS2 and WS2 intralayer excitons is signiﬁcantly suppressed in the heterostructure, illustrating the efﬁcient interlayer charge transfer processes. Layer-selective time-resolved differential reﬂectance measurements show that the electrons excited in MoTe2 can transfer to MoS2 within 0.3 ps. The transferred electrons show a long lifetime of several hundred picoseconds due to their slow recombination with the spatially separated holes that reside in MoTe2. Furthermore, the charge transfer and recombination processes are weakly dependent on the injected carrier density. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing van der Waals multilayer heterostructures involving the infrared-sensitive MoTe2 with emergent properties and provide important information to quantify the performance of MoTe2-based devices.},

While most studies to date have focused on electrons and electron−hole pairs, phonons also play essential roles. Here, we apply ultrafast electron diﬀraction and diﬀuse scattering to directly quantify, with time and momentum resolution, electron−phonon coupling (EPC) in monolayer molybdenum disulﬁde and phonon transport from the monolayer to a silicon nitride substrate. Optically generated hot carriers result in a profoundly anisotropic distribution of phonons in the monolayer within ∼5 ps. A quantitative comparison with ab initio ultrafast dynamics simulations reveals the essential role of dielectric screening in weakening EPC. Thermal transport from the monolayer to the substrate occurs with the phonon system far from equilibrium. While screening in 2D is known to strongly aﬀect equilibrium properties, our ﬁndings extend this understanding to the dynamic regime.},

              Metastable self-organized electronic states in quantum materials are of fundamental importance, displaying emergent dynamical properties that may be used in new generations of sensors and memory devices. Such states are typically formed through phase transitions under non-equilibrium conditions and the final state is reached through processes that span a large range of timescales. Conventionally, phase diagrams of materials are thought of as static, without temporal evolution. However, many functional properties of materials arise as a result of complex temporal changes in the material occurring on different timescales. Hitherto, such properties were not considered within the context of a temporally-evolving phase diagram, even though, under non-equilibrium conditions, different phases typically evolve on different timescales. Here, by using time-resolved optical techniques and femtosecond-pulse-excited scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we track the evolution of the metastable states in a material that has been of wide recent interest, the quasi-two-dimensional dichalcogenide 1

The introduction of a time-domain axis in the phase diagram enables us to follow the evolution of metastable emergent states created by different phase transition mechanisms on different timescales, thus enabling comparison with theoretical predictions of the phase diagram, and opening the way to understanding of the complex ordering processes in metastable materials.},

We show that at high excitation densities, measurements on a single monolayer MoS2 reveal a transient response rich in physical processes. Despite the fact that carriers are excited straight to the A-excitonic state, the time and fluence dependence of the observed optical response indicates exciton dissociation followed by hot-carrier generation. In the picosecond time scale, these hot-carriers form excitons, which have a longer lifetime at higher excitation densities, implying a bottlenecking process. For the use of MoS2 at high-excitation densities, the fluence dependency of the relaxation mechanisms detailed here is essential.},

	abstract = {The coupled nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and phonons in monolayer MoS2 is investigated by combining ﬁrst-principles calculations of the electron−phonon and phonon−phonon interactions with the time-dependent Boltzmann equation. Strict phase-space constraints in the electron−phonon scattering are found to inﬂuence profoundly the decay path of excited electrons and holes, restricting the emission of phonons to crystal momenta close to a few high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. As a result of momentum selectivity in the phonon emission, the nonequilibrium lattice dynamics is characterized by the emergence of a highly anisotropic population of phonons in reciprocal space, which persists for up to 10 ps until thermal equilibrium is restored by phonon−phonon scattering. Achieving control of the nonequilibrium dynamics of the lattice may provide unexplored opportunities to selectively enhance the phonon population of two-dimensional crystals and, thereby, transiently tailor electron−phonon interactions over subpicosecond time scales.},

	abstract = {Van der Waals-coupled two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures have attracted great attention recently due to their high potential in the next-generation photodetectors and solar cells. The understanding of charge-transfer process between adjacent atomic layers is the key to design optimal devices as it directly determines the fundamental response speed and photon-electron conversion eﬃciency. However, general belief and theoretical studies have shown that the charge transfer behavior depends sensitively on interlayer conﬁgurations, which is diﬃcult to control accurately, bringing great uncertainties in device designing. Here we investigate the ultrafast dynamics of interlayer charge transfer in a prototype heterostructure, the MoS2/WS2 bilayer with various stacking conﬁgurations, by optical two-color ultrafast pump−probe spectroscopy. Surprisingly, we found that the charge transfer is robust against varying interlayer twist angles and interlayer coupling strength, in time scale of ∼90 fs. Our observation, together with atomic-resolved transmission electron characterization and time-dependent density functional theory simulations, reveals that the robust ultrafast charge transfer is attributed to the heterogeneous interlayer stretching/ sliding, which provides additional channels for eﬃcient charge transfer previously unknown. Our results elucidate the origin of transfer rate robustness against interlayer stacking conﬁgurations in optical devices based on 2D heterostructures, facilitating their applications in ultrafast and high-eﬃcient optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices in the near future.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are promising building blocks for future ultrathin electronics. Fabricating vdW heterostructures by stamping monolayers at arbitrary angles provides an additional range of ﬂexibility to tailor the resulting properties than could be expected by direct growth. Here, we report fabrication and comprehensive characterizations of WSe2/WS2 bilayer heterojunctions with various twist angles that were synthesized by artiﬁcially stacking monolayers of WS2 and WSe2 grown by chemical vapor deposition. After annealing the WSe2/WS2 bilayers, Raman spectroscopy reveals interlayer coupling with the appearance of a mode at 309.4 cm−1 that is sensitive to the number of WSe2 layers. This interlayer coupling is associated with substantial quenching of the intralayer photoluminescence. In addition, microabsorption spectroscopy of WSe2/WS2 bilayers revealed spectral broadening and shifts as well as a net ∼10\% enhancement in integrated absorption strength across the visible spectrum with respect to the sum of the individual monolayer spectra. The observed broadening of the WSe2 A exciton absorption band in the bilayers suggests fast charge separation between the layers, which was supported by direct femtosecond pump−probe spectroscopy. Density functional calculations of the band structures of the bilayers at diﬀerent twist angles and interlayer distances found robust type II heterojunctions at all twist angles, and predicted variations in band gap for particular atomistic arrangements. Although interlayer excitons were indicated using femtosecond pump−probe spectroscopy, photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopies did not show any evidence of them, suggesting that the interlayer exciton transition is very weak. However, the interlayer coupling for the WSe2/WS2 bilayer heterojunctions indicated by substantial PL quenching, enhanced absorption, and rapid charge transfer was found to be insensitive to the relative twist angle, indicating that stamping provides a robust approach to realize reliable optoelectronics.},

We find that the bands in the K-point valleys are weakly hybridized, with a valence band offset of 300 meV, implying type II band alignment. We deduce that the binding energy of interlayer excitons is more than 200 meV, an order of magnitude higher than that in analogous GaAs structures. Hybridization strongly modifies the bands at Γ, but the valence band edge remains at the K points. We also find that the spectrum of a rotationally aligned heterobilayer reflects a mixture of commensurate and incommensurate domains. These results directly answer many outstanding questions about the electronic nature of MoSe

	abstract = {Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2, M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) hold great potential in optoelectronics and photovoltaics. To achieve eﬃcient lightto-electricity conversion, electron−hole pairs must dissociate into free charges. Coulomb interaction in MX2 often exceeds the charge transfer driving force, leading one to expect ineﬃcient charge separation at a MX2 heterojunction. Experiments defy the expectation. Using time-domain density functional theory and nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics, we show that quantum coherence and donor−acceptor delocalization facilitate rapid charge transfer at a MoS2/ MoSe2 interface. The delocalization is larger for electron than hole, resulting in longer coherence and faster transfer. Stronger NA coupling and higher acceptor state density accelerate electron transfer further. Both electron and hole transfers are subpicosecond, which is in agreement with experiments. The transfers are promoted primarily by the out-of-plane Mo−X modes of the acceptors. Lighter S atoms, compared to Se, create larger NA coupling for electrons than holes. The relatively slow relaxation of the “hot” hole suggests long-distance bandlike transport, observed in organic photovoltaics. The electron−hole recombination is notably longer across the MoS2/MoSe2 interface than in isolated MoS2 and MoSe2, favoring long-lived charge separation. The atomistic, time-domain studies provide valuable insights into excitation dynamics in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.},

Contrary to general expectation, eﬃcient electron−hole separation can occur in vertically stacked transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructure bilayers through ultrafast charge transfer between the neighboring layers despite their weak vdW bonding. In this report, we show by ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations, that instead of direct tunneling, the ultrafast interlayer hole transfer is strongly promoted by an adiabatic mechanism through phonon excitation occurring on 20 fs, which is in good agreement with the experiment. The atomic level picture of the phonon-assisted ultrafast mechanism revealed in our study is valuable both for the fundamental understanding of ultrafast charge carrier dynamics at vdW heterointerfaces as well as for the design of novel quasi-2D devices for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.},

	abstract = {Graphene, a kind of emerging low dimensional carbon material, has admirable thermal properties with potential applications in the thermal management of aerospace and microelectronics fields. In recent studies, thermal properties of both conventional single-layer and multilayer graphene were extensively studied. However, few studies focused on that of multilayer graphene with twist angles, whose thermal properties are different from that of conventional graphene because of the existence of interlayer twist angles. Such knowledge gap hinders the potential applications. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of bilayer, 4-layers and 6-layer zigzag graphene with various twist angles is investigated utilizing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics at the typical temperature region in this study, and both in- and cross-plane thermal conductivity are investigated. The size of the studied graphene is 10 nm × 22 nm in the x-y plane, and the size in the z-direction depends on the number of layers. Moreover, the phonon vibrational density of state is also analyzed for mechanisms behind the thermal transport. The result indicates that a local maximum value can be found with the twist angle of 30° for in-plane thermal conduction. The results also suggest that the highest thermal conductivity could be reached without any twist angles for both in and cross-plane conduction. The observation would provide an opportunity to study the characteristics of in-plane and cross-plane thermal transport of twisted multilayer graphene.},

With the regulation of h from 0  to 30 , the in-plane j of the BLG decreases ﬁrst and then increases showing an asymmetry V shape. The local maximum value of j was reached when the twist angle is 30  and the highest value was found on the Bernal stacked BLG. The obtained j is further found to be sensitive to the Moire periodicity but insensitive to the commensurate lattice constant of the twisted BLG. The non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation reveals that the twist angle in t-BLG affects the proportion of low-frequency phonons and ﬁnally changes the j.

With this technique we can directly engineer MoS2 strain magnitude by changing deposited thin film stress, therefore allowing variable strain to be applied on a flake-to-flake level. These thin film stressors are analogous to SiNx based stressors implemented in industrial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes to enhance Si mobility, suggesting that our concept is highly scalable and may be applied for large-scale integration of strain engineered TMDC devices. We choose optically transparent stressors to allow us to probe MoS2 strain through Raman spectroscopy. Combining thickness dependent analyses of Raman peak shifts in MoS2 with atomistic simulations, we can explore layer-by-layer strain transfer. MoS2 on conventional substrates (SiO2, MgO) show strain transfer into the top two layers of multilayer flakes with limited strain transfer to monolayers due to substrate adhesion. To mitigate this limitation, we also explore stressors on van der Waals heterostructures constructed of monolayer (1L) MoS2 on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). This concept frees the 1L-MoS2 allowing for a 0.85\% strain to be applied to the monolayer with a corresponding strain induced bandgap change of 75 meV. By using thin films with higher stress, strain may be engineered to be even higher. Various stressors and deposition methods are considered, showing a stressor material independent transfer of strain that only depends on stressor film force with negligible defects induced into MoS2 when thermal evaporation is used.},

Heterogeneous integration of nanomaterials has enabled advanced electronics and photonics applications. However, similar progress has been challenging for thermal applications, in part due to shorter wavelengths of heat carriers (phonons) compared to electrons and photons. Here, we demonstrate unusually high thermal isolation across ultrathin heterostructures, achieved by layering atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials. We realize artificial stacks of monolayer graphene, MoS2, and WSe2 with thermal resistance greater than 100 times thicker SiO2 and effective thermal conductivity lower than air at room temperature. Using Raman thermometry, we simultaneously identify the thermal resistance between any 2D monolayers in the stack. Ultrahigh thermal isolation is achieved through the mismatch in mass density and phonon density of states between the 2D layers. These thermal metamaterials are an example in the emerging field of phononics and could find applications where ultrathin thermal insulation is desired, in thermal energy harvesting, or for routing heat in ultracompact geometries.},

            We have investigated experimentally the thermal conductivity of suspended twisted bilayer graphene. The measurements were performed using an optothermal Raman technique. It was found that the thermal conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene is lower than that of monolayer graphene and the reference, Bernal stacked bilayer graphene in the entire temperature range examined (∼300–700 K). This finding indicates that the heat carriers – phonons – in twisted bilayer graphene do not behave in the same manner as that observed in individual graphene layers. The decrease in the thermal conductivity found in twisted bilayer graphene was explained by the modification of the Brillouin zone due to plane rotation and the emergence of numerous folded phonon branches that enhance the phonon Umklapp and normal scattering. The results obtained are important for understanding thermal transport in two-dimensional systems.},

Currently, many theoretical and experimental methods have been developed to characterize the thermal conductivity of 2D materials. In this paper, firstly, typical theoretical methods, such as molecular dynamics, phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and atomic Green\&rsquo;s function method, are introduced and compared. Then, experimental methods, such as suspended micro-bridge, 3\&omega;, time-domain thermal reflectance and Raman methods, are systematically and critically reviewed.

The graphene layers are originally grown on a copper substrate by chemical vapor deposition and later transferred to a silicon substrate in layer-by-layer fashion. We estimate the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) as a function of number of graphene layers, by ﬁtting a layered heat conduction model that accounts for heat accumulation in the gold layer to the TDTR data, using the TBC as a free ﬁtting parameter. The estimated TBC was found to decrease with number of graphene layers at the interface, as observed in previous TDTR measurements reported in the literature. The decrease in TBC with number of graphene layers matches the trends in the transmission coefﬁcient of low frequency (25 GHz) coherent acoustic phonons across the interface, indicating that the interface elastic stiffness decreases with the number of graphene layers due to poor bonding between the gold ﬁlm and silicon substrate.},

For their efficient implementations in the electronic devices while taking care of their overheating issues, the characterization of their thermal transport properties is extremely vital. So, we have systematically investigated the thermal transport properties of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) by combining the first-principles calculations with Boltzmann transport equation. We find that monolayer WTe2 possesses the lowest lattice thermal conductivity κL (33:66 Wm−1K−1 at 300 K) among these six semiconducting materials, in contrast to the highest κL (113:97 Wm−1K−1 at 300 K) of WS2 among them. Further analyses reveal that the higher (lower) anharmonic and isotopic scatterings together with the lower (higher) phonon group velocities lead to the lowest (highest) value of κL in WTe2 (WS2) monolayer. In addition, we have also calculated the cumulative thermal conductivity κC as a function of mean free path, which indicates that the nanostructures with the length of about 400 nm would reduce κL drastically. These results offer important understanding from thermal conductivity point of view to design the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) electronics.},

	abstract = {Ultrathin layers of semiconducting molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2) oﬀer signiﬁcant prospects in future electronic and optoelectronic applications. Although an increasing number of experiments bring light into the electronic transport properties of these crystals, their thermoelectric properties are much less known. In particular, thermoelectricity in chemical vapor deposition grown MoS2, which is more practical for wafer-scale applications, still remains unexplored. Here, for the ﬁrst time, we investigate these properties in grown single layer MoS2. Microfabricated heaters and thermometers are used to measure both electrical conductivity and thermopower. Large values of up to ∼30 mV/K at room temperature are observed, which are much larger than those observed in other two-dimensional crystals and bulk MoS2. The thermopower is strongly dependent on temperature and applied gate voltage with a large enhancement at the vicinity of the conduction band edge. We also show that the Seebeck coeﬃcient follows S ∼ T1/3, suggesting a two-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism in the system, which is consistent with electrical transport measurements. Our results help to understand the physics behind the electrical and thermal transports in MoS2 and the high thermopower value is of interest to future thermoelectronic research and application.},

Devices were fabricated on ﬂexible substrates, and a cantilever sample holder was used to apply uniaxial tensile strain to the various multilayer TMD FETs. Analyzing in particular transfer characteristics, we argue that the modiﬁed device characteristics under strain are clear evidence of a band gap reduction of 100 meV in WSe2 under 1.35\% uniaxial tensile strain at room temperature. Furthermore, the obtained device characteristics imply that the band gap does not shrink uniformly under strain relative to a reference potential deﬁned by the source/drain contacts. Instead, the band gap change is only related to a change of the conduction band edge of WSe2, resulting in a decrease in the Schottky barrier (SB) for electrons without any change for hole injection into the valence band. Simulations of SB device characteristics are employed to explain this point and to quantify our ﬁndings. Last, our experimental results are compared with DFT calculations under strain showing excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and the experimental data presented here.},

Using photoluminescence imaging, we observe a strain-induced reduction of the direct bandgap and funneling of photogenerated excitons toward regions of higher strain. To understand these results, we develop a nonuniform tight-binding model to calculate the electronic properties of MoS2 nanolayers with complex and realistic local strain geometries, ﬁnding good agreement with our experimental results.},

However, the question of how strain relaxes in atomically thin materials remains not well understood. Herein, the strain relaxation of triangular WS2 deposited on polydimethylsiloxane substrate is investigated. The photoluminescence of trions (X–) and excitons (X0) undergoes linear redshifts of ≈20 meV when the substrate tensile strain increases from 0 to 0.16. However, when the substrate strain further increases from 0.16 to 0.32, the redshifts cease due to strain relaxation in WS2. The strain relaxation occurs through formation of wrinkles in the WS2 crystal. The pattern of wrinkles is found to be dependent on the relative angle between an edge of the triangular WS2 crystal and tensile strain direction. Finite element simulations of the strain distribution inside the WS2 crystals explain the experimental observations.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear mechanics of solids is an exciting field that encompasses both beautiful mathematics, such as the emergence of instabilities and the formation of complex patterns, as well as multiple applications. Two-dimensional crystals and van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures allow revisiting this field on the atomic level, allowing much finer control over the parameters and offering atomistic interpretation of experimental observations. In this work, we consider the formation of instabilities consisting of radially oriented wrinkles around mono- and few-layer “bubbles” in two-dimensional vdW heterostructures. Interestingly, the shape and wavelength of the wrinkles depend not only on the thickness of the two-dimensional crystal forming the bubble, but also on the atomistic structure of the interface between the bubble and the substrate, which can be controlled by their relative orientation. We argue that the periodic nature of these patterns emanates from an energetic balance between the resistance of the top membrane to bending, which favors large wavelength of wrinkles, and the membrane-substrate vdW attraction, which favors small wrinkle amplitude. Employing the classical “Winkler foundation” model of elasticity theory, we show that the number of radial wrinkles conveys a valuable relationship between the bending rigidity of the top membrane and the strength of the vdW interaction. Armed with this relationship, we use our data to demonstrate a nontrivial dependence of the bending rigidity on the number of layers in the top membrane, which shows two different regimes driven by slippage between the layers, and a high sensitivity of the vdW force to the alignment between the substrate and the membrane.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) leverage the characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) material building blocks to create a myriad of structures with unique and desirable properties. Several commonly employed fabrication strategies rely on polymeric stamps to assemble layers of 2D materials into vertical stacks. However, the properties of such heterostructures frequently are degraded by contaminants, typically of unknown composition, trapped between the constituent layers. Such contaminants, therefore, impede studies of the intrinsic properties of heterostructures and hinder their application. Here, we use the photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) technique to obtain infrared spectra and maps of the contaminants down to a few attomoles and with nanoscale resolution. Heterostructures comprised of WSe2, WS2, and hexagonal boron nitride layers were found to contain signiﬁcant amounts of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and polycarbonate, corresponding to the stamp materials used in their construction. Additionally, we verify that an atomic force microscope-based “nanosqueegee” technique is an eﬀective method for locally removing contaminants by comparing spectra within as-fabricated and cleaned regions. Having identiﬁed the source of the contaminants, we demonstrate that cleaning PDMS stamps with isopropyl alcohol or toluene prior to vdWH fabrication reduces PDMS contamination within the structures. The general applicability of the PTIR technique for identifying the sources corrupting vdWHs provides valuable guidance for devising mitigation strategies (e.g., stamp cleaning or pre-/post-treatments) and enhances capabilities for producing materials with precisely engineered properties.},

A core problem in the fabrication of these structures is the formation of clean interfaces between the individual two-dimensional materials which would affect device performance. We present here a technique for the rapid batch fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrated by the controlled production of 22 mono-, bi- and trilayer graphene stacks encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride with close to 100\% yield. For the monolayer devices, we found semiclassical mean-free paths up to 0.9 μm, with the narrowest samples showing clear indications of the transport being affected by boundary scattering. The presented method readily lends itself to fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures in both ambient and controlled atmospheres, while the ability to assemble pre-patterned layers paves the way for complex three-dimensional architectures.},

	abstract = {Mechanical exfoliation has been a key enabler of the exploration of the properties of two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, by providing routine access to high-quality material. The original exfoliation method, which remained largely unchanged during the past decade, provides relatively small ﬂakes with moderate yield. Here, we report a modiﬁed approach for exfoliating thin monolayer and few-layer ﬂakes from layered crystals. Our method introduces two process steps that enhance and homogenize the adhesion force between the outermost sheet in contact with a substrate: Prior to exfoliation, ambient adsorbates are eﬀectively removed from the substrate by oxygen plasma cleaning, and an additional heat treatment maximizes the uniform contact area at the interface between the source crystal and the substrate. For graphene exfoliation, these simple process steps increased the yield and the area of the transferred ﬂakes by more than 50 times compared to the established exfoliation methods. Raman and AFM characterization shows that the graphene ﬂakes are of similar high quality as those obtained in previous reports. Graphene ﬁeld-eﬀect devices were fabricated and measured with back-gating and solution top-gating, yielding mobilities of ∼4000 and 12 000 cm2/(V s), respectively, and thus demonstrating excellent electrical properties. Experiments with other layered crystals, e.g., a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) superconductor, show enhancements in exfoliation yield and ﬂake area similar to those for graphene, suggesting that our modiﬁed exfoliation method provides an eﬀective way for producing large area, high-quality ﬂakes of a wide range of 2D materials.},

	abstract = {Layer transfer oﬀers enormous potential for the industrial implementation of two-dimensional (2D) material technology platforms. However, the transfer method used must retain the as-grown uniformity and cleanliness in the transferred ﬁlms for the fabrication of 2D material-based devices. Additionally, the method used must be capable of large-area transfer to maintain wafer-scale fabrication standards. Here, a facile route to transfer centimeter-scale synthesized 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) (3L MoS2, 1L WS2) onto various substrates such as sapphire, SiO2/Si, and ﬂexible substrates (mica, polyimide) has been developed using a water-soluble layer (Na2S/Na2SO4) underneath the as-grown ﬁlm. The developed transfer process represents a fast, clean, generic, and scalable technique to transfer 2D atomic layers. The key strategy used in this process includes the dissolution of the Na2S/ Na2SO4 layer due to the penetration of NaOH solution between the growth substrate and hydrophobic 2D TMDC ﬁlm. As a proof-of-concept device, a broadband photodetector has been fabricated onto the transferred 3L MoS2, which shows photoresponse behavior for a wide range of wavelengths ranging from near-infrared (NIR) to UV. The enhancement in photocurrent was found to be 100 times and 10 times the dark current in the UV and visible regions, respectively. The fabricated photodetector shows a higher responsivity of 8.6 mA/W even at a low applied voltage (1.5 V) and low power density (0.6 μW/mm2). The detector enables a high detectivity of 2.9 × 1011 Jones. This work opens up the pathway toward ﬂexible electronics and optoelectronics.},

Part of these emerging 2D materials are transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). So far there is limited understanding of the cleaning of “monolayer” TMD materials. In this study, we report on the use of downstream H2 plasma to clean the surface of monolayer WS2 grown by MOCVD. We demonstrate that high-temperature processing is essential, allowing to maximize the removal rate of polymers and to mitigate damage caused to the WS2 in the form of sulfur vacancies. We show that low temperature in situ carbonyl sulfide (OCS) soak is an efficient way to resulfurize the material, besides high-temperature H2S annealing. The cleaning processes and mechanisms elucidated in this work are tested on back-gated field-effect transistors, confirming that transport properties of WS2 devices can be maintained by the combination of H2 plasma cleaning and OCS restoration. The low-damage plasma cleaning based on H2 and OCS is very reproducible, fast (completed in a few minutes) and uses a 300 mm industrial plasma etch system qualified for standard semiconductor pilot production. This process is, therefore, expected to enable the industrial scale-up of 2D-based devices, co-integrated with silicon technology.},

	abstract = {The recent interest and excitement in graphene has also opened up a pandora's box of other two-dimensional (2D) materials and material combinations which are now beginning to come to the fore. One family of these emerging 2D materials is transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). So far there is very limited understanding on the wetting behavior of “monolayer” TMD materials. In this study, we synthesized large-area, continuous monolayer tungsten disulﬁde (WS2) and molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2) ﬁlms on SiO2/Si substrates by the thermal reduction and sulfurization of WO3 and MO3 thin ﬁlms. The monolayer TMD ﬁlms displayed an advancing water contact angle of ∼83° as compared to ∼90° for the bulk material. We also prepared bilayer and trilayer WS2 ﬁlms and studied the transition of the water contact angle with increasing number of layers. The advancing water contact angle increased to ∼85° for the bilayer and then to ∼90° for the trilayer ﬁlm. Beyond three layers, there was no signiﬁcant change in the measured water contact angle. This type of wetting transition indicates that water interacts to some extent with the underlying silica substrate through the monolayer TMD sheet. The experimentally observed wetting transition with numbers of TMD layers lies in-between the predictions of one continuum model that considers only van der Waals attractions and another model that considers only dipoleÀdipole interactions. We also explored wetting as a function of aging. A clean single-layer WS2 ﬁlm (without airborne contaminants) was shown to be strongly hydrophilic with an advancing water contact angle of ∼70°. However, over time, the sample ages as hydrocarbons and water present in air adsorb onto the clean WS2 sheet. After ∼7 days, the aging process is completed and the advancing water contact angle of the aged single-layer WS2 ﬁlm stabilizes at ∼83°. These results suggest that clean (i.e., nonaged) monolayer TMDs are hydrophilic materials. We further show that substitution of sulfur atoms by oxygen in the lattice of aged monolayer WS2 and MoS2 ﬁlms can be used to generate well-deﬁned 'hydrophobicÀhydrophilic' patterns that preferentially accumulate and create microdrop arrays on the surface during water condensation and evaporation experiments.},

Although passive cooling in graphene-based devices is quite effective due to graphene’s extraordinary heat conduction, active cooling has not been considered feasible due to graphene’s low thermoelectric power factor. Here, we show that the thermoelectric performance of graphene can be significantly improved by using hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates instead of SiO2. We find the room temperature efficiency of active cooling in the device, as gauged by the power factor times temperature, reaches values as high as 10.35 W⋅m−1⋅K−1, corresponding to more than doubling the highest reported room temperature bulk power factors, 5 W⋅m−1⋅K−1, in YbAl3, and quadrupling the best 2D power factor, 2.5 W⋅m−1⋅K−1, in MoS2. We further show that the Seebeck coefficient provides a direct measure of substrate-induced random potential fluctuations and that their significant reduction for hBN substrates enables fast gate-controlled switching of the Seebeck coefficient polarity for applications in integrated active cooling devices.},

	abstract = {We investigate the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivities of molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2) using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We ﬁnd that the in-plane thermal conductivity of monolayer MoS2 is about 19.76 W mK−1. Interestingly, the in-plane thermal conductivity of multilayer MoS2 is insensitive to the number of layers, which is in strong contrast to the in-plane thermal conductivity of graphene where the interlayer interaction strongly affects the in-plane thermal conductivity. This layer number insensitivity is attributable to the ﬁnite energy gap in the phonon spectrum of MoS2, which makes the phonon–phonon scattering channel almost unchanged with increasing layer number. For the cross-plane thermal transport, we ﬁnd that the cross-plane thermal conductivity of multilayer MoS2 can be effectively tuned by applying cross-plane strain. More speciﬁcally, a 10\% cross-plane compressive strain can enhance the thermal conductivity by a factor of 10, while a 5\% cross-plane tensile strain can reduce the thermal conductivity by 90\%. Our ﬁndings are important for thermal management in MoS2 based nanodevices and for thermoelectric applications of MoS2.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and graphene compose a new family of crystalline materials with atomic thicknesses and exotic mechanical, electronic, and optical properties. Due to their inherent exceptional mechanical flexibility and strength, these 2D materials provide an ideal platform for strain engineering, enabling versatile modulation and significant enhancement of their optical properties. For instance, recent theoretical and experimental investigations have demonstrated flexible control over their electronic states via application of external strains, such as uniaxial strain and biaxial strain. Meanwhile, many nondestructive optical measurement methods, typically including absorption, reflectance, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopies, can be readily exploited to quantitatively determine strain-engineered optical properties. This review begins with an introduction to the macroscopic theory of crystal elasticity and microscopic effective low-energy Hamiltonians coupled with strain fields, and then summarizes recent advances in strain-induced optical responses of 2D TMDCs and graphene, followed by the strain engineering techniques. It concludes with exciting applications associated with strained 2D materials, discussions on existing open questions, and an outlook on this intriguing emerging field.},

In this Review, nanostructural composites are shown to exhibit nanostructures and properties that show promise for thermoelectric applications, thus bringing together low-dimensional and bulk materials for thermoelectric applications. Particular emphasis is given in this Review to the ability to achieve 1) a simultaneous increase in the power factor and a decrease in the thermal conductivity in the same nanocomposite sample and for transport in the same direction and 2) lower values of the thermal conductivity in these nanocomposites as compared to alloy samples of the same chemical composition.

The ﬁlamentary contact is formed through an oxidized TiN layer on the bottom electrode, and thermal conﬁnement is achieved using a monolayer semiconductor interface, three-atom thick MoS2. The former reduces the switching volume of the phase change material and yields a 70\% reduction in reset current versus typical 150 nm diameter mushroom cells. The enhanced thermal conﬁnement achieved with the ultra-thin (\$6 A˚ ) MoS2 yields an additional 30\% reduction in switching current and power. We also use detailed simulations to show that further tailoring the electrical and thermal interfaces of such PCM cells toward their fundamental limits could lead up to a sixfold beneﬁt in power efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {The process chain of energy conversion from primary energy carriers to final energy use is subject to several losses. Especially in end use, vast amounts of converted energy occur as waste heat, which is often released to the environment. In terms of raising energy efficiency and reducing the energy consumption, such waste heat needs to be used. To date, some studies or investigations about industrial waste heat of selected countries have been carried out, but other sectors like commerce were not considered. Therefore, this work presents a novel top-down approach for the estimation of waste heat potential of the most common sectors of end use (transportation, industrial, commercial and residential) including electricity generation on a global scale. It also deals with the temperature distribution of this unused energy. The evaluation reveals that 72\% of the global primary energy consumption is lost after conversion. In further detail, 63\% of the considered waste heat streams arise at a temperature below 100°C in which electricity generation has the largest share followed by transportation and industry.},

Within the virial radius of the Milky Way (224 kpc here), 53 of 55 dwarf galaxies are devoid of gas to limits of M H i \&lt; 104 M ⊙. Within the virial radius of M31 (266 kpc), 27 of 30 dwarf galaxies are devoid of gas (with limits typically \&lt;105 M ⊙). Beyond the virial radii of the Milky Way and M31, the majority of the dwarf galaxies have detected H i gas and H i masses higher than the limits. When the relationship between gas content and distance is investigated using a Local Group virial radius, more of the nondetected dwarf galaxies are within this radius (85 ± 1 of the 93 nondetected dwarf galaxies) than within the virial radii of the Milky Way and M31. Using the Gaia proper-motion measurements available for 38 dwarf galaxies, the minimum gas density required to completely strip them of gas is calculated. Halo densities between 10−5 and 5 × 10−4 cm−3 are typically required for instantaneous stripping at perigalacticon. When compared to halo density with radius expectations from simulations and observations, 80\% of the dwarf galaxies with proper motions are consistent with being stripped by ram pressure at Milky Way pericenter. The results suggest that a diffuse gaseous galactic halo medium is important in quenching dwarf galaxies, and that a Local Group medium also potentially plays a role.},

A 2 Ms Chandra X-ray image of Cygnus A has revealed an approximately circular hole, with a radius of 3.9 kpc, centered on the primary hotspot in the eastern radio lobe, hotspot E. We infer the distribution of X-ray emission on our line of sight from an X-ray surface brightness profile of the radio lobe adjacent to the hole and use it to argue that the hole is excavated from the radio lobe. The surface brightness profile of the hole implies a depth at least 1.7 ± 0.3 times greater than its projected width, requiring a minimum depth of 13.3 ± 2.3 kpc. A similar hole observed in the 5 GHz Very Large Array radio map reinforces the argument for a cavity lying within the lobe. We argue that the jet encounters the shock compressed intracluster medium at hotspot E, passing through one or more shocks as it is deflected back into the radio lobe. The orientation of Cygnus A allows the outflow from hotspot E to travel almost directly away from us, creating an elongated cavity, as observed. These results favor models for multiple hotspots in which an FR II jet is deflected at a primary hotspot, then travels onward to deposit the bulk of its power at a secondary hotspot, rather than the dentist drill model.},

	abstract = {Multiscale simulations are used to study the structural relaxation in twisted graphene bilayers and the associated electron diffraction patterns. The initial twist forms an incommensurate moiré pattern that relaxes to a commensurate microstructure comprised of a repeating pattern of alternating low-energy AB and BA domains surrounding a high-energy AA domain. The simulations show that the relaxation mechanism involves a localized rotation and shrinking of the AA domains that scales in two regimes with the imposed twist. For small twisting angles, the localized rotation tends to a constant; for large twist, the rotation scales linearly with it. This behavior is tied to the inverse scaling of the moiré pattern size with twist angle and is explained theoretically using a linear elasticity model. The results are validated experimentally through a simulated electron diffraction analysis of the relaxed structures. A complex electron diffraction pattern involving the appearance of weak satellite peaks is predicted for the small twist regime. This new diffraction pattern is explained using an analytical model in which the relaxation kinematics are described as an exponentially-decaying (Gaussian) rotation field centered on the AA domains. Both the angle-dependent scaling and diffraction patterns are in quantitative agreement with experimental observations. A Matlab program for extracting the Gaussian model parameters accompanies this paper.},

By comparing PV cell parameters across technologies, we appraise how far each technology may progress in the near future.

We further integrate nine GRAPE panels for a total panel area of 4.5 m2 in a stand-alone solar farm infrastructure with peak power exceeding 250 W, proving the scalability of this technology. We provide insights on the system operation by analysing the panel characteristics as a function of temperature and light intensity. The analysis, carried out over a months-long timescale, highlights the key role of the lamination process of the panels on the entire system degradation.

	abstract = {The power conversion efficiency of thin film solar cells based on organic and perovskite materials has improved dramatically in recent years, currently reaching above 18\% for organic photovoltaics and above 25\% for perovskite solar cells. Combined with their appealing properties, such as mechanical flexibility, light weight, semi-transparency, and low-cost large-scale roll-to-roll (R2R) processing compatibility, the high conversion efficiencies have placed organic and perovskite solar cells at the center of attention in terms of promising PV technologies. In this context, 2D materials are, due to their unique properties such as high charge carrier mobility, high optical transparency and especially tunable electronic structure, ideal contact layer materials in thin film solar cell devices. They can be applied as electrodes, hole (HTL) and electron (ETL) transport layers, and additives in active layers. This review paper focuses on the integration of 2D graphene and its derivatives, and 2D materials beyond graphene, i.e. transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMD), MXene, black phosphorous (BP) and boron nitrides in organic and perovskite solar cells, and discusses the positive influence these material systems have shown on both the fundamental photophysical processes, as well as on device stability and lifetime. Furthermore, this review addresses the future potential of 2D materials for the development of lightweight, eco-friendly, high performance and cost-effective flexible solar cells, provided by the high mechanical flexibility, high environmental stability, low electrical resistivity, and low environmental impact of these 2D material systems.},

With the scaling trends in photovoltaics moving toward thinner active materials, the atomically thin bodies and high flexibility of 2D materials make them the obvious choice for integration with future-generation photovoltaic technology. Not only can graphene, with its high transparency and conductivity, be used as the electrodes in solar cells, but also its ambipolar electrical transport enables it to serve as both the anode and the cathode. 2D materials beyond graphene, such as transition-metal dichalcogenides, are direct-bandgap semiconductors at the monolayer level, and they can be used as the active layer in ultrathin flexible solar cells. However, since no 2D material has been featured in the roadmap of standard photovoltaic technologies, a proper synergy is still lacking between the recently growing 2D community and the conventional solar community. A comprehensive review on the current state-of-the-art of 2D-materials-based solar photovoltaics is presented here so that the recent advances of 2D materials for solar cells can be employed for formulating the future roadmap of various photovoltaic technologies.},

However, challenges such as Fermi-level pinning at the metal contact–TMD interface and the inapplicability of traditional doping schemes have prevented most TMD solar cells from exceeding 2\% power conversion efficiency (PCE). In addition, fabrication on flexible substrates tends to contaminate or damage TMD interfaces, further reducing performance. Here, we address these fundamental issues by employing: (1) transparent graphene contacts to mitigate Fermi-level pinning, (2) MoOx capping for doping, passivation and anti-reflection, and (3) a clean, non-damaging direct transfer method to realize devices on lightweight flexible polyimide substrates. These lead to record PCE of 5.1\% and record specific power of 4.4 W g−1 for flexible TMD (WSe2) solar cells, the latter on par with prevailing thin-film solar technologies cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium selenide, amorphous silicon and III-Vs. We further project that TMD solar cells could achieve specific power up to 46 W g−1, creating unprecedented opportunities in a broad range of industries from aerospace to wearable and implantable electronics.},

We ﬁnd that the thermal properties of thin ﬁlms (κ and g) are 1 order of magnitude lower than that for bulk or monolayer WS2, which is caused by a reduction in ﬂake size and an increase in boundary scattering.

The thermal conductivity of graphene laminate was found to be in the range from 40 to 90 W/mK at room temperature. It was found unexpectedly that the average size and the alignment of graphene ﬂakes are more important parameters deﬁning the heat conduction than the mass density of the graphene laminate. The thermal conductivity scales up linearly with the average graphene ﬂake size in both uncompressed and compressed laminates. The compressed laminates have higher thermal conductivity for the same average ﬂake size owing to better ﬂake alignment.

Strain engineering is a powerful tool in designing artificial platforms for high-temperature excitonic quantum devices. Combining strong light-matter interaction with robust and mobile exciton quasiparticles, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) hold great promise in this endeavor. However, realizing complex excitonic architectures based on strain-induced electronic potentials alone has proven to be exceptionally difficult so far. Here, we demonstrate deterministic strain engineering of both single-particle electronic bandstructure and excitonic many-particle interactions. We create quasi-1D transport channels to confine excitons and simultaneously enhance their mobility through locally suppressed exciton-phonon scattering. Using ultrafast, all-optical injection and time-resolved readout, we realize highly directional exciton flow with up to 100\% anisotropy both at cryogenic and room temperatures. The demonstrated fundamental modification of the exciton transport properties in a deterministically strained 2D material with effectively tunable dimensionality has broad implications for both basic solid-state science and emerging technologies.},

              Temperature dependent Raman intensity of 2D materials features very rich information about the material's electronic structure, optical properties, and nm-level interface spacing. To date, there still lacks rigorous consideration of the combined effects. This renders the Raman intensity information less valuable in material studies. In this work, the Raman intensity of four supported multilayered WS
              2
              samples are studied from 77 K to 757 K under 532 nm laser excitation. Resonance Raman scattering is observed, and we are able to evaluate the excitonic transition energy of B exciton and its broadening parameters. However, the resonance Raman effects cannot explain the Raman intensity variation in the high temperature range (room temperature to 757 K). The thermal expansion mismatch between WS
              2
              and Si substrate at high temperatures (room temperature to 757 K) make the optical interference effects very strong and enhances the Raman intensity significantly. This interference effect is studied in detail by rigorously calculating and considering the thermal expansion of samples, the interface spacing change, and the optical indices change with temperature. Considering all of the above factors, it is concluded that the temperature dependent Raman intensity of the WS
              2
              samples cannot be solely interpreted by its resonance behavior. The interface optical interference impacts the Raman intensity more significantly than the change of refractive indices with temperature.},

For single-layer WS2, the 514.5 nm laser excitation generates a second-order Raman resonance involving the longitudinal acoustic mode (LA(M)). This resonance results from a coupling between the electronic band structure and lattice vibrations. First-principles calculations were used to determine the electronic and phonon band structures of single-layer and bulk WS2. The reduced intensity of the 2LA mode was then computed, as a function of the laser wavelength, from the fourth-order Fermi golden rule. Our observations establish an unambiguous and nondestructive Raman fingerprint for identifying single- and few-layered WS2 films.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic light–matter characteristics of transition-metal dichalcogenides have not only been of great scientific interest but have also provided novel opportunities for the development of advanced optoelectronic devices. Among the family of transition-metal dichalcogenide structures, the one-dimensional nanotube is particularly attractive because it produces a spontaneous photocurrent that is prohibited in its higher-dimensional counterparts. Here, we show that WS2 nanotubes exhibit a giant shift current near the infrared region, amounting to four times the previously reported values in the higher frequency range. The wall-to-wall charge shift constitutes a key advantage of the one-dimensional nanotube geometry, and we consider a Janus-type heteroatomic configuration that can maximize this interwall effect. To assess the nonlinear effect of a strong field and the nonadiabatic effect of atomic motion, we carried out direct real-time integration of the photoinduced current using time-dependent density functional theory. Our findings provide a solid basis for a complete quantum mechanical understanding of the unique light–matter interaction hidden in the geometric characteristics of the reduced dimension.},

	abstract = {The photovoltaic effect in traditional p–n junctions—where a p-type material (with an excess of holes) abuts an n-type material (with an excess of electrons)—involves the light-induced creation of electron–hole pairs and their subsequent separation, generating a current. This photovoltaic effect is particularly important for environmentally benign energy harvesting, and its efficiency has been increased dramatically, almost reaching the theoretical limit1. Further progress is anticipated by making use of the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)2, which does not require a junction and occurs only in crystals with broken inversion symmetry3. However, the practical implementation of the BPVE is hampered by its low efficiency in existing materials4–10. Semiconductors with reduced dimensionality2 or a smaller bandgap4,5 have been suggested to be more efficient. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are exemplary small-bandgap, two-dimensional semiconductors11,12 in which various effects have been observed by breaking the inversion symmetry inherent in their bulk crystals13–15, but the BPVE has not been investigated. Here we report the discovery of the BPVE in devices based on tungsten disulfide, a member of the TMD family. We find that systematically reducing the crystal symmetry beyond mere broken inversion symmetry—moving from a two-dimensional monolayer to a nanotube with polar properties—greatly enhances the BPVE. The photocurrent density thus generated is orders of magnitude larger than that of other BPVE materials. Our findings highlight not only the potential of TMD-based nanomaterials, but also more generally the importance of crystal symmetry reduction in enhancing the efficiency of converting solar to electric power.},

UHV technologies may once again revolutionize research in low dimensions by facilitating the construction of ultra-clean interfaces with a wide variety of 2D materials. Here, we describe the design and operation of a UHV 2D material device fabrication system, in which the entire fabrication process is performed under pressure lower than 5 × 10−10 mbar. Specifically, the UHV system enables the exfoliation of atomically clean 2D materials. Subsequent in situ assembly of van der Waals heterostructures produces high-quality interfaces that are free of contamination.

	abstract = {Based on the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the heat conduction in a novel deformation of graphene, named graphene wrinkle (GW), is investigated. Distinct from pristine graphene, the GW exhibits a relatively low thermal conductivity. We observe that the low thermal conductivity stems from the strong phonon localizations, which are concentrated on the joint regions between crests and troughs of wrinkles. The suppression in GW thermal conductivity could be further attributed to the enhanced phonon scatterings, as evidenced by the vibrational density of states (VDOS) attenuation in the low frequency region, the G-band redshift of VDOS due to the ﬂattened phonon dispersion curves (low phonon group velocities), and the decreased phonon lifetime. In addition, we ﬁnd that the thermal conductivity of GW is almost insensitive to temperature in the range between 200 and 600 K. It is induced by the signiﬁcant contribution of low frequency phonon modes, which are more inﬂuential in the direction perpendicular to the wrinkle texture. This study provides physical insight into the mechanisms of thermal transport in GWs and oﬀers design guidelines for applications of GW related devices.},

            In this paper, the anisotropic thermal conductivity characteristics of graphene wrinkles are observed for the first time using a non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method. Our results reveal that the wrinkling level has little effect on the thermal conductivity along the wrinkling direction. However, the wrinkling level plays an important role in the reduction of thermal conductivity along the texture direction, which results from the contributions of increased bond length, von Mises stress, broadening of phonon modes and G-band redshift. These results indicate that graphene wrinkles can be a promising candidate to modulate thermal conductivity properties in nanoscale thermal managements and thermoelectric devices.},

Challenges remain, in simplifying, identifying scaling techniques and deriving design guidelines for the manufacture of large-scale acoustic metamaterials to transform laboratory prototypes to useful devices. However, research in this area is rapidly evolving with the necessary building blocks that can be additively manufactured or assembled to form metamaterials. In this regard, the article provides a general introduction into acoustic metamaterials followed by their qualifiers.

The vdW interactions are modeled using long-range interlayer potentials, such as Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Kolmogorov–Crespi (KC), that are expensive to compute in atomistic and multiscale simulations. We propose a discrete–continuum (DC) effective potential for LJ and KC that includes full atomistic resolution in the short range and a continuum integral approximation outside. This reduces the computational cost by two orders of magnitude while retaining excellent accuracy. With this method, we examine the relation between stacking states and interlayer energy of a graphene bilayer under relative in-plane translations and rotations. We compare the performance of LJ and KC and characterize the moiré patterns under rotation. We find that the energy of an infinite graphene bilayer is constant with rotation (with discontinuities at special angles) and explain this in terms of the moiré pattern supercell. We also find that the saddle point (SP) stacking configuration becomes the stable ground state (as opposed to AB stacking) when the bilayer is compressed.},

We show twisted 2D materials contain a torsional displacement field comprised of three transverse periodic lattice distortions (PLD). The torsional PLD amplitude provides a single order parameter that concisely describes the structural complexity of twisted bilayer moirés. Moreover, the structure and amplitude of a torsional periodic lattice distortion is quantifiable using rudimentary electron diffraction methods sensitive to reciprocal space. In twisted bilayer graphene, the torsional PLD begins to form at angles below 3.89° and the amplitude reaches 8 pm around the magic angle of 1. 1°. At extremely low twist angles (e.g. below 0.25°) the amplitude increases and additional PLD harmonics arise to expand Bernal stacked domains separated by well defined solitonic boundaries. The torsional distortion field in twisted bilayer graphene is analytically described and has an upper bound of 22.6 pm.

To achieve this, the controllable growth of wafer-scale TMDs single crystals or periodic single-crystal patterns are fundamental issues. Herein, we present a universal route for synthesizing arrays of unidirectionally orientated monolayer TMDs ribbons (e.g., MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2, MoSxSe2-x), by using the step edges of high-miller-index Au facets as templates. Density functional theory calculations regarding the growth kinetics of specific edges have been performed to reveal the morphological transition from triangular domains to patterned ribbons. More intriguingly, we find that, the uniformly aligned TMDs ribbons can merge into single-crystal films through a one-dimensional edge epitaxial growth mode. This work hereby puts forward an alternative pathway for the direct synthesis of inch-scale uniform monolayer TMDs single-crystals or patterned ribbons, which should promote their applications as channel materials in high-performance electronics or other fields.},

	abstract = {Van der Waals layered materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are an exciting class of materials with weak interlayer bonding, which enables one to create so-called van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH). One promising attribute of vdWH is the ability to rotate the layers at arbitrary azimuthal angles relative to one another. Recent work has shown that control of the twist angle between layers can have a dramatic eﬀect on TMD vdWH properties, but the twist angle has been treated solely through the use of rigid-lattice moiré patterns. No atomic reconstruction, that is, any rearrangement of atoms within the individual layers, has been reported experimentally to date. Here, we demonstrate that vdWH of MoSe2/WSe2 and MoS2/WS2 at twist angles ≤1° undergo signiﬁcant atomic level reconstruction leading to discrete commensurate domains divided by narrow domain walls, rather than a smoothly varying rigid-lattice moiré pattern as has been assumed in prior experimental work. Using conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM), we show that TMD vdWH at small twist angles exhibit large domains of constant conductivity. The domains in samples with R-type stacking are triangular, whereas the domains in samples with H-type stacking are hexagonal. Transmission electron microscopy provides additional evidence of atomic reconstruction in MoSe2/ WSe2 structures and demonstrates the transition between a rigid-lattice moiré pattern for large angles and atomic reconstruction for small angles. We use density functional theory to calculate the band structures of the commensurate reconstructed domains and ﬁnd that the modulation of the relative electronic band edges is consistent with the CAFM results and photoluminescence spectra. The presence of atomic reconstruction in TMD heterostructures and the observed impact on nanometer-scale electronic properties provide fundamental insight into the behavior of this important class of heterostructures.},

	abstract = {Abstract Heterostructures formed by 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and graphene are not only fundamentally important for the exploration of novel interface physics but also indispensable for various optoelectronic devices. Often multiple effects such as charge transfer (CT), heating, and strain are present simultaneously and their interplay significantly impacts the properties of such heterostructures. However, the identification and separation of these three individual effects are challenging and have not been demonstrated in 2D heterostructures. Here, through a concurrent analysis of the Raman modes and photoluminescence spectra from graphene and WS2 in temperature- and power-dependent measurements, this work has succeeded in disentangling the effects of light-induced CT, heating, and strain effects in WS2/graphene heterostructure on SiO2/Si substrate. Without disentangling these effects, the light-induced carrier density in graphene (WS2) would have been underestimated (overestimated) by up to 62\% (73\%) in this situation. More importantly, a positive temperature coefficient of the G-mode Raman shift is obtained without excluding the strain and CT effects, contrary to the negative coefficient due to the intrinsic thermal effect. This study demonstrates the importance of disentangling the individual effects and the approach paves the way for a comprehensive understanding of electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of TMDC/graphene heterostrucutres.},

From photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, the trion and neutral exciton deformation potentials are found to be similar, approximately −130 meV/\%. It is shown that the excess carrier concentration as well as residual strain in WS2 samples can be determined from the PL spectra. The experimental Grüneisen parameter of the in-plane E′ Raman mode for 1L-WS2 is found to be equal to the corresponding mode (E2g) mode in bulk WS2. The impact of mechanical strain on the electronic and phonon band structures is also calculated in the framework of density functional theory. The theoretically obtained deformation potential for the direct transition is in very good agreement with the experiment. The reduced dimensionality of the monolayer enables the visualization over the entire Brillouin zone of both the calculated phonon dispersions and the Grüneisen parameters, which are compared with the experimentally accessible ones. This work contributes to the experimental implementation of mechanical strain engineering applications in semiconducting two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, tremendous research has been conducted on the discovery, design and synthesis, characterization, and applications of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Thermal conductivity and interface thermal conductance/resistance of 2D materials are two critical properties in their applications. Raman spectroscopy, which measures the inelastic scattering of photons by optical phonons, can distinct a 2D material's temperature from its surrounding materials', featuring unprecedented spatial resolution (down to the atomic level). Raman-based thermometry has been used tremendously for characterizing the thermal conductivity of 2D materials (suspended or supported) and interface thermal conductance/resistance. Very large data deviations have been observed in literature, partly due to physical phenomena and factors not considered in measurements. Here, we provide a critical review, analysis, and perspectives about a broad spectrum of physical problems faced in Raman-based thermal characterization of 2D materials, namely interface separation, localized stress due to thermal expansion mismatch, optical interference, conjugated phonon, and hot carrier transport, optical–acoustic phonon thermal nonequilibrium, and radiative electron–hole recombination in monolayer 2D materials. Neglect of these problems will lead to a physically unreasonable understanding of phonon transport and interface energy coupling. In-depth discussions are also provided on the energy transport state-resolved Raman (ET-Raman) technique to overcome these problems and on future research challenges and needs.},

It employs a square-wave modulated laser of varying duty cycle to realize controlled heating and transient thermal probing. Very well defined extension of the heating time in each measurement changes the temperature evolution profile and the probed temperature field at μs resolution. Using this new technique, the transient thermal response of a tipless Si cantilever is investigated along the length direction. A physical model is developed to reconstruct the Raman spectrum considering the temperature evolution, while taking into account the temperature dependence of the Raman emission. By fitting the variation of the normalized Raman peak intensity, wavenumber, and peak area against the heating time, the thermal diffusivity is determined as 9.17 × 10{\textbackslash}textminus5, 8.14 × 10{\textbackslash}textminus5, and 9.51 × 10{\textbackslash}textminus5 m2/s.

	abstract = {We report a novel approach for non-contact simultaneous determination of the hot carrier diffusion coefficient (D) and interface thermal resistance (R) of sub-10 nm virgin mechanically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets on c-Si. The effect of hot carrier diffusion in heat conduction by photon excitation, diffusion, and recombination is identified by varying the heating spot size from 0.294 μm to 1.14 μm (radius) and probing the local temperature rise using Raman spectroscopy. R is determined as 4.46–7.66 × 10−8 K m2 W−1, indicating excellent contact between MoS2 and c-Si. D is determined to be 1.18+0.30−0.23, 1.07+0.37−0.26, 1.20+0.34−0.27 and 1.62+0.30−0.23 cm2 s−1 for 3.6 nm, 5.4 nm, 8.4 nm, and 9.0 nm thick MoS2 samples, showing little dependence on the thickness. The hot carrier diffusion length (LD) can be determined without knowledge of the hot carrier's life-time. The four samples LD is determined as 0.344+0.041−0.036 (3.6 nm), 0.327+0.052−0.043 (5.4 nm), 0.346+0.046−0.042 (8.4 nm), and 0.402+0.036−0.030 μm (9.0 nm). Unlike previous methods that are implemented by making electrical contact and applying an electric field for D measurement, our technique has the advantage of being truly non-contact and non-invasive, and is able to characterize the electron diffusion behavior of virgin 2D materials. Also it points out that hot carrier diffusion needs to be taken into serious consideration in Raman-based thermal property characterization of 2D materials, especially under very tightly focused laser heating whose spot size is comparable to the hot carrier diffusion length.},

This work explores the potential of energy-transport state-resolved Raman (ET-Raman) for the precise determination of interfacial thermal conductance (G) between monolayer 2D materials and their substrates. ET-Raman employs a continuous wave laser and nanosecond (ns) pulsed laser to induce both steady state and transient heating while simultaneously collecting 2D material temperature information from the Raman signal. A 3D numerical model built using the finite volume method simulates the two differentiated thermal transport processes. The simulated temperature rises are compared with experimental Raman temperature information to extract G. In this study, we investigate the temporal effects of the pulse frequency and pulse width of the ns laser on precise characterization of G. By running multiple simulations for a range of pulsed laser frequencies and pulse widths, we determine that ET-Raman is most sensitive to precise interfacial thermal conductance measurements with short pulse widths ( below 20 ns) and with pulsing frequencies that ensure sufficient cooling time between consecutive pulses ( below 500 kHz). We also conclude that substrate thickness and laser spot size play critical roles in heat distribution and subsequent sensitivity to meaningful G measurements. As both laser spot size and SiO2 substrate thickness decrease, detection of interfacial thermal transport becomes more difficult. These results offer essential guidance in the design of future Raman-based approaches to thermal measurements using pulsed lasers.},

The higher Gk of thicker samples reveals their better interface contact with the substrate, leading to accordingly improved interfacial energy coupling. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to interpret and compare with the experimental observations. MD simulations predict a thermal conductance in the range of 53–77 MW m−2 K−1, which agrees well with the upper bound Gk measured in our work.

	abstract = {Thermal boundary conductance (TBC) is critical in many thermal and energy applications. A decades-old puzzle has been that many of the measured TBCs, such as those well characterized across Al/Si and ZnO/GaN interfaces, signiﬁcantly exceed theoretical results or even the absolute upper limit called the “radiation limit”, suggesting the failure of the theory. Here, we identify that for high-transmission interfaces, the commonly assumed phonon local thermal equilibrium adjacent to the interface fails, and the measurable phonon temperatures are not their emission temperature. We hence develop a “nonequilibrium Landauer approach” and deﬁne the unique “dressed” and “intrinsic” TBCs. Combining our approach even with a simple diﬀuse mismatch model (DMM) nearly doubles the theoretical TBCs across the Al/Si and ZnO/GaN interfaces, and the theoretical results agree with experiments for the ﬁrst time. The radiation limit is also redeﬁned and found to increase over 100\% over the original radiation limit, and it can now well bound all the experimental data.},

Here we use extreme ultraviolet beams to study phonon transport dynamics in a 3D nanostructured silicon metalattice with deep nanoscale feature size and observe dramatically reduced thermal conductivity relative to bulk. To explain this behavior, we develop a predictive theory wherein thermal conduction separates into a geometric permeability component and an intrinsic viscous contribution, arising from a new and universal effect of nanoscale confinement on phonon flow. Using experiments and atomistic simulations, we show that our theory applies to a general set of highly confined silicon nanosystems, from metalattices, nanomeshes, porous nanowires, to nanowire networks, of great interest for next-generation energy-efficient devices.},

Through steady-state measurements, strain has been proved in terms of its modulation of electronic energy bands and optoelectronic properties in TMDs. However, the influence of strain on the spin−orbit coupling as well as its related valley excitonic dynamics remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the effect of strain on the excitonic dynamics of monolayer WS2 via steady-state fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy. Combined with theoretical calculations, we found that tensile strain can reduce the spin-splitting value of the conduction band and lead to transitions between different exciton states via spin-flip mechanism. Our findings suggest that the spin-flip process is strain-dependent, provides a reference for application of valleytronic devices, where tensile strain is usually existing during their design and fabrication.},

	abstract = {Monolayer molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2), a new two-dimensional material beyond graphene, has attracted tremendous attention recently. Its applications in nanoelectronic and thermoelectric devices usually require manipulating the thermal transport properties. Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the eﬀects of lattice defects and mechanical strain on the thermal conductivity of MoS2. We found that the thermal conductivity of monolayer MoS2 can be eﬀectively tuned by introducing even a small amount of lattice defects. For example, a 0.5\% concentration of mono-Mo vacancies is able to reduce the thermal conductivity by about 60\%. Remarkably, the thermal conductivity of the defected sample can further be tuned by mechanical strain. For example, a 12\% tensile strain is able to reduce the thermal conductivity by another 60\%. We also found that the tensile strain exerts almost the same impact on the thermal conductivity of both pristine and defective MoS2, which signiﬁes that there is no apparent coupling between defects and strain in aﬀecting the thermal conductivity. Our analyses of the vibrational density of state and spectral energy density show that the underlying mechanisms for these drastic changes are (1) the reduction of the phonon relaxation time arising from phonon−defect scattering and (2) the reduction of the group velocity and heat capacity caused by tensile strain. Our ﬁndings here provide important insights and guidelines for the use of monolayer MoS2 in thermal management and thermoelectric devices.},

          , 
            Wrinkles in supported graphenes can be formed either by uniaxial compression or uniaxial tension beyond a certain critical load depending on the mode of loading. In the first case, the wrinkling direction is normal to the compression axis whereas in tension, wrinkles of the same pattern are formed parallel to the loading direction due to Poisson's (lateral) contraction. Herein we show by direct AFM observations that in simply-supported graphenes such instabilities appear as periodic wrinkles over existing stochastic undulations caused by the underlying-substrate-roughness. The critical strain for the generation of these wrinkles in both tension and compression is less than 1\% which particularly for the former is far lower than the predicted tensile strain to fracture of suspended graphene estimated at ∼30\%. Based on these findings, a constitutive model that provides the critical tensile strain for induced buckling in the lateral direction is proposed that depends only on the graphene-support interaction and not on the nature of the substrate. Understanding the wrinkling failure of graphenes under strain is of paramount importance as it leads to new threshold limits beyond which the physical–mechanical properties of graphene are impaired.},

              Since 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit strain-tunable bandgaps, locally confining strain can allow lateral manipulation of their band structure, in-plane carrier transport and optical transitions. Herein, we show that a single wrinkle (width = 10 nm–10 μm) on an MoS
              2
              flake can induce confined uniaxial strain to reduce the local bandgap (40–60 meV per \% deformation), producing a microscopic exciton funnel with an enhancement in photocurrent over flat MoS

              devices. This study also shows that wrinkles can spatially reconfigure the distribution of dopants and enhance the light absorption in the MoS

              flat–wrinkle-flat device-structure, a higher carrier mobility and an improvement in the on/off ratio were exhibited in the devices with a single wrinkle. This phenomenon is attributed to the built-in potential induced by the bandgap reduction at the wrinkle site and the change in doping of the suspended wrinkle. The wrinkle-induced tunability of the local bandgap and manipulation of the spatial transport barriers, and the enhanced light absorption can enable development of next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices guided by in-plane deformation of 2D nanomaterials.},

Mechanical strain can reduce the symmetry of a crystal and even weak strain can have a considerable impact on the SHG intensity along different polarization directions. The impact of strain on the SHG can be modeled with a second-order nonlinear photoelastic tensor. In this work, we determined the photoelastic tensors at a fundamental wavelength of 800 nm for four different transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers: MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2. Strain is applied using a three-point bending scheme, and the polarization-resolved SHG pattern is measured in backscattering geometry. Furthermore, we connected the strain dependent SHG with the strain dependence of the A-exciton energy. With the second-order nonlinear photoelastic tensor, full strain information can be accurately extracted from polarization-resolved SHG measurements. Accordingly, uniaxial strain, induced by polydimethylsiloxan (PDMS) exfoliation and transfer, is measured. We ﬁnd that TMD monolayers fabricated with PDMS are strained by ∼0.2\%. With the experimentally determined nonlinear photoelastic tensors, it will be possible to optically probe arbitrary strain ﬁelds in TMD monolayers.},

              There has been a massive growth in the study of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) over the past decade, based upon their interesting and unusual electronic, optical and mechanical properties, such as tuneable and strain-dependent bandgaps. Tungsten disulphide (WS
              2
              ), as a typical example of TMDs, has considerable potential in applications such as strain engineered devices and the next generation multifunctional polymer nanocomposites. However, controlling the strain, or more practically, monitoring the strain in WS
              2
              and the associated micromechanics have not been so well studied. Both photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy have been proved to be effective but PL cannot be employed to characterise multilayer TMDs while it is difficult for Raman spectroscopy to reveal the band structure. In this present study, PL and Raman spectroscopy have been combined to monitor the strain distribution and stress transfer of monolayer WS
              2
              on a flexible polymer substrate and in polymer nanocomposites. It is demonstrated that WS
              2
              still follows continuum mechanics on the microscale and that strain generates a non-uniform bandgap distribution even in a single WS
              2
              flake through a simple strain engineering. It is shown that these flakes could be useful in optoelectronic applications as they become micron-sized PL emitters with a band gap that can be tuned by the application of external strain to the substrate. The analysis of strain distributions using Raman spectroscopy is further extended to thin-film few-layer WS
              2
              polymer nanocomposites where it is demonstrated that the stress can be transferred effectively to WS
              2
              flakes. The relationship between the mechanical behaviour of single monolayer WS
              2
              flakes and that of few-layer flakes in bulk composites is investigated.},

	abstract = {Triggered by the expanding demands of semiconductor devices, strain engineering of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has garnered considerable research interest. Through steady-state measurements, strain has been proved in terms of its modulation of electronic energy bands and optoelectronic properties in TMDs. However, the influence of strain on the spin−orbit coupling as well as its related valley excitonic dynamics remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the effect of strain on the excitonic dynamics of monolayer WS2 via steady-state fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy. Combined with theoretical calculations, we found that tensile strain can reduce the spin-splitting value of the conduction band and lead to transitions between different exciton states via spin-flip mechanism. Our findings suggest that the spin-flip process is strain-dependent, provides a reference for application of valleytronic devices, where tensile strain is usually existing during their design and fabrication.},

The emergent two-dimensional, atomic layered materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides, are highly ﬂexible; thus buckles and wrinkles can be easily generated and play vital roles in the corresponding physical properties. Here we introduce one kind of patterned buckling behavior caused by the delamination from a substrate initiated at the edges of the chemical vapor deposition synthesized monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, led by thermal expansion mismatch. The atomic force microscopy and optical characterizations clearly showed the puckered structures associated with the strain, whereas the transmission electron microscopy revealed the special sawtooth-shaped edges, which break the geometrical symmetry for the buckling behavior of hexagonal samples. The condition of the edge delamination is in accordance with the fracture behavior of thin ﬁlm interfaces. This edge delamination and buckling process is universal for most ultrathin two-dimensional materials, which requires more attention in various future applications.},

However, they are found at random locations within the host material and usually in low densities, hindering experiments aiming to investigate this new class of emitters. Here, we create deterministic arrays of hundreds of quantum emitters in tungsten diselenide and tungsten disulphide monolayers, emitting across a range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum (610–680 nm and 740–820 nm), with a greater spectral stability than their randomly occurring counterparts. This is achieved by depositing monolayers onto silica substrates nanopatterned with arrays of 150-nm-diameter pillars ranging from 60 to 190 nm in height. The nanopillars create localized deformations in the material resulting in the quantum confinement of excitons. Our method may enable the placement of emitters in photonic structures such as optical waveguides in a scalable way, where precise and accurate positioning is paramount.},

	abstract = {Abstract Bismuth telluride is the working material for most Peltier cooling devices and thermoelectric generators. This is because Bi2Te3 (or more precisely its alloys with Sb2Te3 for p-type and Bi2Se3 for n-type material) has the highest thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, of any material around room temperature. Since thermoelectric technology will be greatly enhanced by improving Bi2Te3 or finding a superior material, this review aims to identify and quantify the key material properties that make Bi2Te3 such a good thermoelectric. The large zT can be traced to the high band degeneracy, low effective mass, high carrier mobility, and relatively low lattice thermal conductivity, which all contribute to its remarkably high thermoelectric quality factor. Using literature data augmented with newer results, these material parameters are quantified, giving clear insight into the tailoring of the electronic band structure of Bi2Te3 by alloying, or reducing thermal conductivity by nanostructuring. For example, this analysis clearly shows that the minority carrier excitation across the small bandgap significantly limits the thermoelectric performance of Bi2Te3, even at room temperature, showing that larger bandgap alloys are needed for higher temperature operation. Such effective material parameters can also be used for benchmarking future improvements in Bi2Te3 or new replacement materials.},

It is found that the monolayer forms a stable low-buckled hexagonal structure, which is reminiscent of silicene. The electronic transport properties of the monolayer bismuth are then evaluated by using Boltzmann theory with the relaxation time approximation. By ﬁtting ﬁrst-principles total energy calculations, a modiﬁed Morse potential is constructed, which is used to predicate the lattice thermal conductivity via equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The room temperature ZT value of a monolayer bismuth is estimated to be 2.1 and 2.4 for the n- and p-type doping, respectively. Moreover, the temperature dependence of ZT is investigated and a maximum value of 4.1 can be achieved at 500 K.},

	abstract = {Monolayer molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2), a new two-dimensional material beyond graphene, has attracted tremendous attention recently. Its applications in nanoelectronic and thermoelectric devices usually require manipulating the thermal transport properties. Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the eﬀects of lattice defects and mechanical strain on the thermal conductivity of MoS2. We found that the thermal conductivity of monolayer MoS2 can be eﬀectively tuned by introducing even a small amount of lattice defects. For example, a 0.5\% concentration of mono-Mo vacancies is able to reduce the thermal conductivity by about 60\%. Remarkably, the thermal conductivity of the defected sample can further be tuned by mechanical strain. For example, a 12\% tensile strain is able to reduce the thermal conductivity by another 60\%. We also found that the tensile strain exerts almost the same impact on the thermal conductivity of both pristine and defective MoS2, which signiﬁes that there is no apparent coupling between defects and strain in aﬀecting the thermal conductivity. Our analyses of the vibrational density of state and spectral energy density show that the underlying mechanisms for these drastic changes are (1) the reduction of the phonon relaxation time arising from phonon−defect scattering and (2) the reduction of the group velocity and heat capacity caused by tensile strain. Our ﬁndings here provide important insights and guidelines for the use of monolayer MoS2 in thermal management and thermoelectric devices.},

	abstract = {For practical application, determining the thermal and mechanical characterization of nanoporous two-dimensional MoS2 membranes is critical. To understand the influences of the temperature and porosity on the mechanical properties of single-layer MoS2 membrane, uniaxial and biaxial tensions were conducted using molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that Young’s modulus, ultimate strength, and fracture strain reduce with the temperature increases. At the same time, porosity effects were found to cause a decrease in the ultimate strength, fracture strain, and Young’s modulus of MoS2 membranes. Because the pore exists, the most considerable stresses will be concentrated around the pore site throughout uniaxial and biaxial tensile tests, increasing the possibility of fracture compared to tensing the pristine membrane. Moreover, this article investigates the impacts of temperature, porosity, and length size on the thermal conductivity of MoS2 membrane using the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) method. The results show that the thermal conductivity of the MoS2 membrane is strongly dependent on the temperature, porosity, and length size. Specifically, the thermal conductivity decreases as the temperature increases, and the thermal conductivity reduces as the porosity density increases. Interestingly, the thermal and mechanical properties of the pristine MoS2 membrane are similar in armchair and zigzag directions.},

An additional development, introduced in this paper, involves the use of a thermoelectric (TE) module in order to generate electricity to power the fan and give light. The air blowing through the stove increases the air/fuel ratio to achieve a complete combustion. In the first part, the paper presents the results from an experimental benchtest using commercial TE modules (Bismuth Telluride). The evaluation of the conversion efficiency is allowed at various temperature ranges. Then, the feasibility of adding commercial TE modules to the biomass cook stove prototype is investigated searching the best position of the modules.

	abstract = {Thermal conductivity of homogeneous twisted stacks of graphite is found to strongly depend on the misﬁt angle. The underlying mechanism relies on the angle dependence of phonon−phonon couplings across the twisted interface. Excellent agreement between the calculated thermal conductivity of narrow graphitic stacks and corresponding experimental results indicates the validity of the predictions. This is attributed to the accuracy of interlayer interaction descriptions obtained by the dedicated registry-dependent interlayer potential used. Similar results for h-BN stacks indicate overall higher conductivity and reduced misﬁt angle variation. This opens the way for the design of tunable heterogeneous junctions with controllable heat-transport properties ranging from substrate-isolation to eﬃcient heat evacuation.},

	abstract = {Photoinduced charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures occurs on the 100 fs timescale despite weak interlayer coupling and momentum mismatch. However, little is understood about the microscopic mechanism behind this ultrafast process and the role of the lattice in mediating it. Here, using femtosecond electron diffraction, we directly visualize lattice dynamics in photoexcited heterostructures of WSe2/WS2 monolayers. Following the selective excitation of WSe2, we measure the concurrent heating of both WSe2 and WS2 on a picosecond timescale—an observation that is not explained by phonon transport across the interface. Using first-principles calculations, we identify a fast channel involving an electronic state hybridized across the heterostructure, enabling phonon-assisted interlayer transfer of photoexcited electrons. Phonons are emitted in both layers on the femtosecond timescale via this channel, consistent with the simultaneous lattice heating observed experimentally. Taken together, our work indicates strong electron–phonon coupling via layer-hybridized electronic states—a novel route to control energy transport across atomic junctions.},

              Understanding the electrical and thermal transport properties of materials is critical to the design of electronics, sensors, and energy conversion devices. Computational modeling can accurately predict material properties but, in order to be reliable, requires accurate descriptions of electron and phonon states and their interactions. While first-principles methods are capable of describing the energy spectrum of each carrier, using them to compute transport properties is still a formidable task, both computationally demanding and memory intensive, requiring integration of fine microscopic scattering details for estimation of macroscopic transport properties. To address this challenge, we present Phoebe—a newly developed software package that includes the effects of electron–phonon, phonon–phonon, boundary, and isotope scattering in computations of electrical and thermal transport properties of materials with a variety of available methods and approximations. This open source
              C++
              code combines MPI-OpenMP hybrid parallelization with GPU acceleration and distributed memory structures to manage computational cost, allowing Phoebe to effectively take advantage of contemporary computing infrastructures. We demonstrate that Phoebe accurately and efficiently predicts a wide range of transport properties, opening avenues for accelerated computational analysis of complex crystals.},

This, however, has not been fully realized in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to the diﬃculty of homogeneously controlling the dopant concentrations and the lack of systematic study of the net impact of substitutional dopants separate from that of the unintentional doping from the device fabrication processes. Here, we grow wafer-scale, continuous MoS2 monolayers with tunable concentrations of Nb and Re and fabricate devices using a polymer-free approach to study the direct electrical impact of substitutional dopants in MoS2 monolayers. In particular, the electrical conductivity of Nb doped MoS2 in the absence of electrostatic gating is reproducibly tuned over 7 orders of magnitude by controlling the Nb concentration. Our study further indicates that the dopant carriers do not fully ionize in the 2D limit, unlike in their three-dimensional analogues, which is explained by weaker charge screening and impurity band conduction. Moreover, we show that the dopants are stable, which enables the doped ﬁlms to be processed as independent building blocks that can be used as electrodes for functional circuitry.},

Here, we use stroboscopic optical scattering microscopy to visualize nanoscale heat transport in disordered ﬁlms of gold nanocrystals. We ﬁnd that heat transport appears subdiﬀusive at the nanoscale. Finite element simulations show that tortuosity of the heat ﬂow underlies the subdiﬀusive transport, owing to a distribution of nonconductive voids. Thus, while heat travels diﬀusively through contiguous regions of the ﬁlm, the tortuosity causes heat to navigate circuitous pathways that make the observed mean-squared expansion of an initially localized temperature distribution appear subdiﬀusive on length scales comparable to the voids. Our approach should be broadly applicable to uncover the impact of both designed and unintended heterogeneities in a wide range of materials and devices that can aﬀect more commonly used spatially averaged thermal transport measurements.},

Here, we use stroboscopic optical scattering microscopy to visualize nanoscale heat transport in disordered ﬁlms of gold nanocrystals. We ﬁnd that heat transport appears subdiﬀusive at the nanoscale. Finite element simulations show that tortuosity of the heat ﬂow underlies the subdiﬀusive transport, owing to a distribution of nonconductive voids. Thus, while heat travels diﬀusively through contiguous regions of the ﬁlm, the tortuosity causes heat to navigate circuitous pathways that make the observed mean-squared expansion of an initially localized temperature distribution appear subdiﬀusive on length scales comparable to the voids. Our approach should be broadly applicable to uncover the impact of both designed and unintended heterogeneities in a wide range of materials and devices that can aﬀect more commonly used spatially averaged thermal transport measurements.},

	abstract = {Thermoelectric devices convert thermal energy to electrical energy and are particularly well-suited for energy harvesting from waste heat. Even as the number of electronic devices used in daily life proliferates, technical advances diminish the average power such devices require to perform a given function. Localized thermal gradients that abound in our living environments, despite having modest energy densities, are therefore becoming increasingly viable and attractive to power such devices. With this motivation, we report the design, fabrication, and characterization of single-wall carbon nanotube thermoelectric devices (CNT-TDs) on ﬂexible polyimide substrates as a basis for wearable energy converters. Our aqueous-solution-based ﬁlm fabrication process could enable readily scalable, low-cost TDs; here, we demonstrate CNT-hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) composite thermoelectric ﬁlms by aerosol jet printing. The electrical conductivity of the composite ﬁlms is controlled through the number of CNT/HPC layers printed in combination with control of the annealing conditions. The HPC initially disperses the CNTs in deionized water, the greenest of solvents, and is subsequently partially eliminated from the ﬁlm by annealing, with concomitant morphological changes that we characterized by TEM. HPC removal is key to obtaining good electrical conductivity (0.94 to 1.10 Â 105 S/m) and Seebeck coefﬁcients (36 to 43 lV/K). We also report a power factor of 208 lW mÀ1 KÀ2 for a CNT-TD composed of 15 layers of CNT/HPC, promising performance for CNT-based ﬂexible TDs that are deposited from aqueous solution, stable in air, and require no additional doping or sorting processes.},

	abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are layered materials that have a semiconducting phase with many advantageous optoelectronic properties, including tightly bound excitons and spinvalley locking. In Tungsten-based TMDs, spin and momentum forbidden transitions give rise to dark excitons that typically are optically inaccessible but represent the lowest excitonic states of the system. Dark excitons can deeply affect transport, dynamics and coherence of bright excitons, hampering device performance. Therefore, it is crucial to create conditions in which these excitonic states can be visualized and controlled. Here, we show that compressive strain in WS2 enables phonon scattering of photoexcited electrons between momentum valleys, enhancing the formation of dark intervalley excitons. We show that the emission and spectral properties of momentum-forbidden excitons are accessible and strongly depend on the local strain environment that modifies the band alignment. This mechanism is further exploited for strain sensing in twodimensional semiconductors revealing a gauge factor exceeding 104.},

The resulting strain ﬁeld facilitates strong carrier localization due to its pronounced inﬂuence on the band gap. Additionally, we consider charge carrier conﬁnement due to local changes of the dielectric environment and show that both eﬀects contribute to modiﬁed electronic states and optical properties. The interplay of surface wrinkling, strain-induced conﬁnement, and local changes of the dielectric environment is demonstrated for the example of nanobubbles that form when monolayers are deposited on substrates or other two-dimensional materials.},

Here we experimentally demonstrate that moderate strain values ({\textasciitilde}2\%) can already trigger an indirect bandgap transition and induce a finite charge carrier density in 2D MoS2 layers. A conclusive proof of the direct-to-indirect bandgap transition is provided by directly comparing the electronic and optical bandgaps of strained MoS2 single layers obtained from tunneling spectroscopy and photoluminescence measurements of MoS2 nanobubbles. Upon 2\% biaxial tensile strain, the electronic gap becomes significantly smaller (1.45 ± 0.15 eV) than the optical direct gap (1.73 ± 0.1 eV), clearly evidencing a strain-induced direct to indirect bandgap transition. Moreover, the Fermi level can shift inside the conduction band already in moderately strained ({\textasciitilde}2\%) MoS2 single layers conferring them a metallic character.},

For instance, electrons and holes in 2D semiconductors like MoS2 monolayers exhibit a unique coupling between the spin and the crystal momentum, also referred to as the valley. A crucial requirement for future applications is therefore the possibility to initialise the spin/valley degree of freedom in these materials. Here we investigate the optical initialisation of the valley degree of freedom in charge-tunable MoS2 monolayers encapsulated with hexagonal boron nitride at cryogenic temperatures. We report in photoluminescence a large steady state valley polarization of the different excitonic complexes following circularly-polarized laser excitation. We reveal efficient valley initialisation of positively-charged excitons, which have so far proved to be elusive in non-encapsulated monolayers due to defect and laser-induced large electron doping. We find that negatively-charged excitons present a polarization of 70\% which is unusually large for non-resonant excitation. We attribute this large valley polarization to the particular band structure of MoS2. In addition, we demonstrate that circular excitation induces a dynamical polarization of resident electrons and holes––as recently shown in tungsten-based monolayers.},

	abstract = {Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers have exceptional physical properties. They show bright photoluminescence due to their unique band structure and absorb more than 10\% of the light at their excitonic resonances despite their atomic thickness. At room temperature, the width of the exciton transitions is governed by the exciton−phonon interaction leading to strongly asymmetric line shapes. TMDC monolayers are also extremely ﬂexible, sustaining mechanical strain of about 10\% without breaking. The excitonic properties strongly depend on strain. For example, exciton energies of TMDC monolayers signiﬁcantly redshift under uniaxial tensile strain. Here, we demonstrate that the width and the asymmetric line shape of excitonic resonances in TMDC monolayers can be controlled with applied strain. We measure photoluminescence and absorption spectra of the A exciton in monolayer MoSe2, WSe2, WS2, and MoS2 under uniaxial tensile strain. We ﬁnd that the A exciton substantially narrows and becomes more symmetric for the selenium-based monolayer materials, while no change is observed for atomically thin WS2. For MoS2 monolayers, the line width increases. These eﬀects are due to a modiﬁed exciton−phonon coupling at increasing strain levels because of changes in the electronic band structure of the respective monolayer materials. This interpretation based on steady-state experiments is corroborated by time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. Our results demonstrate that moderate strain values on the order of only 1\% are already suﬃcient to globally tune the exciton−phonon interaction in TMDC monolayers and hold the promise for controlling the coupling on the nanoscale.},

Reduction of the 2H-1T′ phase transition temperature of MoTe2 to room temperature was realized by introducing a tensile strain of 0.2\%. The observed ﬁrst-order SM transition improved conductance ∼10 000 times and was made possible by an unusually large temperature-stress coeﬃcient, which results from a large volume change and small latent heat. The demonstrated strain-modulation of the phase transition temperature is expected to be compatible with other TMDs enabling the 2D electronics utilizing polymorphism of TMDs along with the established materials.},

Here we develop a new ReaxFF reactive potential that can accurately describe the thermodynamic and structural properties of MoS2 sheets, guided by extensive density functional theory simulations. This potential is then applied to the formation energies of ﬁve diﬀerent types of vacancies, various vacancy migration barriers, and the transition barrier between the semiconducting 2H and metallic 1T phases. The energetics of ripplocations, a recently observed defect in van der Waals layers, is examined, and the interplay between these defects and sulfur vacancies is studied. As strain engineering of MoS2 sheets is an eﬀective way to manipulate the sheets’ electronic and optical properties, the new ReaxFF description can provide valuable insights into morphological changes that occur under various loading conditions and defect distributions, thus allowing one to tailor the electronic properties of these 2D crystals.},

	abstract = {Currently, galvanometric scanning systems (like the one used in a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer) rely on a planar calibration procedure between a two-dimensional (2D) camera and the laser galvanometric scanning system to automatically aim a laser beam at a particular point on an object. In the case of nonplanar or moving objects, this calibration is not sufficiently accurate anymore. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) calibration procedure that uses a 3D range sensor is proposed. The 3D calibration is valid for all types of objects and retains its accuracy when objects are moved between subsequent measurement campaigns. The proposed 3D calibration uses a Non-Perspective-n-Point (NPnP) problem solution. The 3D range sensor is used to calculate the position of the object under test relative to the laser galvanometric system. With this extrinsic calibration, the laser galvanometric scanning system can automatically aim a laser beam to this object. In experiments, the mean accuracy of aiming the laser beam on an object is below 10 mm for 95\% of the measurements. This achieved accuracy is mainly determined by the accuracy and resolution of the 3D range sensor. The new calibration method is significantly better than the original 2D calibration method, which in our setup achieves errors below 68 mm for 95\% of the measurements.},

Although a tremendous number of earlier studies focus on graphene and its derivatives, other emerging elemental 2D materials, such as borophene, silicene, black phosphorene, antimonene, tellurene, bismuthene and arsenene, are attracting increasing research interest in electronics and optoelectronics, as well as various energy storage and conversion applications, owing to their unique structural, electrochemical and electronic properties. In particular, emerging elemental 2D materials often possess large surface areas, high theoretical capacity, structural anisotropicity, high carrier mobility and tunable bandgaps, making them promising candidates in many energy storage and conversion technologies. Recently, we have witnessed remarkable progress in the preparation, characterization, and application of many emerging elemental 2D materials. However, the challenging yet vastly different synthetic strategies and resulting physicochemical properties, along with complex theoretical and experimental results, make it difficult to navigate through their applications in specific research fields. In this perspective, we summarize the progress of emerging elemental 2D materials in terms of their preparation methods, properties and figures of merit in energy storage and catalytic applications. Furthermore, we present our insight into the challenges and opportunities, which would hopefully shed light on the great potential of this ever-expanding field.},

Although nanostructuring was proposed to improve the thermoelectric performance of graphene, little experimental progress has been accomplished. Here, we carefully fabricated as-grown suspended graphene nanoribbons with quartermicron length and ∼40 nm width. The ratio of electrical to thermal conductivity was enhanced by 1−2 orders of magnitude, and the Seebeck coeﬃcient was several times larger than bulk graphene, which yielded record-high ZT values up to ∼0.1. Moreover, we observed a record-high electronic contribution of ∼20\% to the total thermal conductivity in the nanoribbon. Concurrent phonon Boltzmann transport simulations reveal that the reduction of lattice thermal conductivity is mainly attributed to quasi-ballistic phonon transport. The record-high ratio of electrical to thermal conductivity was enabled by the disparate electron and phonon mean free paths as well as the clean samples, and the enhanced Seebeck coeﬃcient was attributed to the band gap opening. Our work not only demonstrates that electron and phonon transport can be fundamentally tuned and decoupled in graphene but also indicates that graphene with appropriate nanostructures can be very promising thermoelectric materials.},

However, little is known about heat flow in two-dimensional devices or interconnects with dimensions comparable to the phonon mean free path. Here we find that short, quarter-micron graphene samples reach {\textasciitilde}35\% of the ballistic thermal conductance limit up to room temperature, enabled by the relatively large phonon mean free path ({\textasciitilde}100 nm) in substrate-supported graphene. In contrast, patterning similar samples into nanoribbons leads to a diffusive heat-flow regime that is controlled by ribbon width and edge disorder. In the edge-controlled regime, the graphene nanoribbon thermal conductivity scales with width approximately as {\textasciitilde}W1.80.3, being about 100 W m−1 K−1 in 65-nm-wide graphene nanoribbons, at room temperature.

We also discuss the future opportunities and research directions in this field, such as developing advanced techniques to probe the emergent photonics and optoelectronics in an individual moiré supercell; exploring new ferroelectric, magnetic, and multiferroic moiré systems; and using external degrees of freedom to engineer moiré properties for exciting physics and potential technological innovations. Moiré patterns develop when two or more periodic lattices are overlaid over each other. These long-range patterns can also be seen in two-dimensional materials and give rise to rich physics within these quantum materials systems. Du et al. reviewed recent developments in moiré-patterned two-dimensional materials with a focus on the photonic and optoelectronic aspects and how the properties can be controlled by engineering the stacking order and twist angle between the layers.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is employed following acetone dissolution, thermal annealing, and ultraviolet-ozone (UV-O3) treatment of PMMA-coated MoS2 samples. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the eﬃcacy of polymer residue removal procedures and oxidation resistance of the diﬀerent samples. Acetone dissolution followed by ultra-high vacuum (UHV) annealing was highly eﬀective in removing carbon residues from one type of geological sample however not for a synthetic sample produced by sulfurization. Similarly, diﬀerent types of samples require varying lengths of UV-O3 exposure time for proper removal of residues, and some exhibit oxidation as a result. UV-O3 exposure followed by a UHV anneal resulted in successful removal of carbon residues from MoS2 produced by sulfurization while a substantial carbon signal remained on a chemical vapor deposited MoS2 sample subjected to the same process. Diﬀerences in the eﬀects of removal procedures are attributed to diﬀerences in surface morphology and material quality. For device fabrication applications, this work highlights the importance of developing PMMA removal processes speciﬁc to the MoS2 used with full consideration for the processing required to obtain the MoS2.},

In this work, we demonstrate a reﬁned version of the optothermal Raman technique1,2 to measure the thermal transport properties of two TMDC materials, MoS2 and MoSe2, in single-layer (1L) and bilayer (2L) forms. This new version incorporates two crucial improvements over previous implementations. First, we utilize more direct measurements of the optical absorption of the suspended samples under study and ﬁnd values ∼40\% lower than previously assumed. Second, by comparing the response of fully supported and suspended samples using diﬀerent laser spot sizes, we are able to independently measure the interfacial thermal conductance to the substrate and the lateral thermal conductivity of the supported and suspended materials. The approach is validated by examining the response of a suspended ﬁlm illuminated in diﬀerent radial positions. For 1L MoS2 and MoSe2, the room-temperature thermal conductivities are 84 ± 17 and 59 ± 18 W/(m·K), respectively. For 2L MoS2 and MoSe2, we obtain values of 77 ± 25 W and 42 ± 13 W/(m·K). Crucially, the interfacial thermal conductance is found to be of order 0.1− 1 MW/m2 K, substantially smaller than previously assumed, a ﬁnding that has important implications for design and modeling of electronic devices.},

We used frequency domain thermoreflectance to study the cross-plane thermal transport in mechanically exfoliated MoS2 samples supported on SiO2 and muscovite mica substrates. The thickness of MoS2 ranged between one and five layers, and the MoS2 layers were sandwiched between a metal layer and the substrate. In the case of mica, heat transport into the substrate remained the same whether or not a monolayer of MoS2 was present, whereas, for SiO2, heat transport was reduced by surface roughness. We observed a significant improvement in heat transport across monolayer MoS2 as compared to few layer MoS2. For MoS2 on SiO2, the effective thermal interface conductance was improved by more than three times if a monolayer was used. For MoS2 on mica, the thermal interface conductance was approximately two times better for monolayer MoS2. This implies that monolayer MoS2 has superior thermal properties and can be used in electronic devices as an intermediate layer between two materials. Additionally, we also report on the measurement of anisotropic thermal conductivity in bulk MoS2 and mica.},

The properties of the transducer and its interface to the sample are then important to the interpretation of results, and heat conduction in the transducer layer can limit measurements of ultra-thin samples or in-plane conductivity. We demonstrate the feasibility of measuring semiconductor samples using standard TDTR instrumentation, without the use of a metal transducer. A mathematical model accounting for non-zero laser penetration depth as well as both thermal and charge carrier effects is presented, and the ability of the model to describe and fit to experimental data for silicon and germanium samples is demonstrated. Though at this stage measurement uncertainties are larger than for traditional TDTR, we anticipate that the use of this technique will expand the range of samples that can be measured with existing TDTR setups.},

Here, we present the first correlated nanoscale mapping of the interface of atomically thin WSe2 with noble metals using co-localized scanning probe microscopy and tip-enhanced optical spectroscopy (TEOS), such as tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). Nanoscale maps of the topography, surface potential, Raman spectra, and the photocurrent amplitude of the WSe2/metal interfaces reveal striking results. Specifically, correlations between surface potential, resonant Raman signatures and photocurrents that indicate the presence of inhomogeneities within interfacial electronic properties, which we attribute to variations in the local doping of the WSe2 likely caused by intrinsic compositional fluctuations or defects. Our results suggest that local electrostatic variations at a lateral scale of 10–100 nm are present even in the highest quality of TMDC crystals and must be considered towards understanding of all interfacial phenomena, particularly in device applications that rely on the buried metal–semiconductor junction interface.},

Yet measuring the thermal conductivity tensor of such materials remains a challenge, particularly for materials lacking in-plane symmetry (i.e., transversely anisotropic materials). This paper demonstrates thermal conductivity tensor measurements for transversely anisotropic materials, by extending beam-offset frequency-domain thermoreflectance (BO-FDTR) methods which had previously been limited to transversely isotropic materials. Extensive sensitivity analysis is used to determine an appropriate range of heating frequencies and beam offsets to extract various tensor elements. This technique is demonstrated on a model transversely anisotropic material, x-cut quartz ({\textless}110{\textgreater} α-SiO2), by combining beam offset measurements from different sample orientations to reconstruct the full in-plane thermal conductivity tensor. The technique is also validated by measurements on two transversely isotropic materials, sapphire and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The anisotropic measurements demonstrated very good self-consistency in correctly identifying isotropic directions when present, with residual anisotropy errors below 4\% for sapphire and 2\% for HOPG and quartz. Finally, a computational case study (simulated experiment) shows how the arbitrary in-plane thermal conductivity tensor of a fictitious material with high in-plane anisotropy can in principle be obtained from only a single sample orientation, rather than multiple orientations like the experiments on x-cut quartz.},

	abstract = {In-plane thermal conductivities of small-scale samples are hard to measure, especially for the lowly conductive ones and those lacking in-plane symmetry (i.e., transversely anisotropic materials). State-of-the-art pump-probe techniques including both the time-domain and the frequency-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR and FDTR) are advantageous in measuring the thermal conductivity of small-scale samples, and various advanced TDTR and FDTR techniques have been developed to measure transversely anisotropic materials. However, the measurable in-plane thermal conductivity (kin) is usually limited to be {\textgreater}10W/(m·K). In this work, a new spatial-domain thermoreflectance (SDTR) method has been developed to measure a broad range of kin of millimeter-scale small samples, including those lacking in-plane symmetry, extending the current limit of the measurable kin to as low as 1 W/(m·K). This SDTR method establishes a new scheme of measurements using the optimized laser spot size and modulation frequency and a new scheme of data processing, enabling measurements of in-plane thermal conductivity tensors of a broad range of kin values with both high accuracy and ease of operation. Some details such as the requirement on the sample geometry, the effect of the transducer layer, and the effect of heat loss are also discussed. As a verification, the kin of some transversely isotropic reference samples with a wide range of kin values including fused silica, sapphire, silicon, and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) have been measured using this new SDTR method. The measured kin agree perfectly well with the literature values with a typical uncertainty of {\textless}5\%. As a demonstration of the unique capability of this method, the in-plane thermal conductivity tensor of x-cut quartz, an in-plane anisotropic material, has also been measured.},

We experimentally demonstrate that the phonon thermal conductivity of MgO thin films is proportional to the crystal’s coherence length, a property of a solid that quantifies the length scale associated with crystalline imperfections. Sputter-deposited films were prepared on (100)-oriented silicon and then annealed to vary the crystalline coherence, as characterized using x-ray diffraction line broadening. We find that the measured thermal conductivity of the MgO films varies proportionally with crystalline coherence length, which is ultimately limited by the grain size. The microstructural length scales associated with crystalline defects, such as small-angle tilt boundaries, dictate this crystalline coherence length, and our results demonstrate the role that this length scale has on the phonon thermal conductivity of thin films. Our results suggest that this crystalline coherence length scale provides a measure of the limiting phonon mean free path in crystalline solids, a quantity that is often difficult to measure and observe with more traditional imagining techniques.},

For time- and frequency-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR and FDTR) that rely on modulated laser sources, we decouple the modulated and steady-state temperature profiles to understand the conditions needed to achieve a single temperature approximation throughout the experimental volume, allowing for the estimation of spatially invariant thermal parameters within this volume. We consider low thermal conductivity materials, including amorphous silicon dioxide (a-SiO2), polymers, and disordered C60, to demonstrate that often-used analytical expressions fail to capture this temperature rise under realistic experimental conditions, such as when a thin-film metal transducer is used or when pump and probe spot sizes are significantly different. To validate these findings and demonstrate a practical approach to simultaneously calculate the steady-state temperature and extract thermal parameters in TDTR, we present an iterative algorithm for obtaining the steady-state temperature rise and measure the thermal conductivity and thermal boundary conductance of a-SiO2 with a 65-nm gold thin film transducer. Furthermore, we discuss methods of heat dissipation to include the use of conductive substrates as well as the use of bidirectional heat flow geometries. Finally, we quantify the influence of the optical penetration depth (OPD) on the steady-state temperature rise to reveal that only when the OPD approaches the characteristic length of the temperature decay does it alter the temperature profile relative to the surface heating condition.},

Unlike 3D covalent network solids, the TMDCs are layered crystals featuring strong in-plane covalent bonding and weak out-of-plane vdW interaction, which allow the crack propagation depth to be reduced to the atomic scale. By adjusting the residual stress of the stressor ﬁlm, we controlled the crack propagation depth at a scale corresponding to the monolayer thickness of the TMDCs. Consequently, mono-, bi-, and trilayer TMDCs were selectively separated from the vdW crystals. The presented results show huge potential for the manufacture of layer-engineered, high-quality vdW materials, which can be developed into functional optoelectronic devices.},

High-performance detectors are needed in scattering experiments to obtain maximum scientific value from every probe particle. We deploy a hybrid pixel array direct electron detector to perform ultrafast electron diffraction experiments on a WSe2/MoSe2 2D heterobilayer, resolving the weak features of diffuse scattering and moiré superlattice structure without saturating the zero order peak. Enabled by the detector’s high frame rate, we show that a chopping technique provides diffraction difference images with signal-to-noise at the shot noise limit. Finally, we demonstrate that a fast detector frame rate coupled with a high repetition rate probe can provide continuous time resolution from femtoseconds to seconds, enabling us to perform a scanning ultrafast electron diffraction experiment that maps thermal transport in WSe2/MoSe2 and resolves distinct diffusion mechanisms in space and time.},

The quasiparticle (QP) band structures with spin−orbit coupling are calculated in the G0W0 approximation, and comparison is made with diﬀerent density functional theory descriptions. Pitfalls related to the convergence of GW calculations for two-dimensional (2D) materials are discussed together with possible solutions. The monolayer band edge positions relative to vacuum are used to estimate the band alignment at various heterostructure interfaces. The sensitivity of the band structures to the in-plane lattice constant is analyzed and rationalized in terms of the electronic structure. Finally, the q-dependent dielectric functions and eﬀective electron and hole masses are obtained from the QP band structure and used as input to a 2D hydrogenic model to estimate exciton binding energies. Throughout the paper we focus on trends and correlations in the electronic structure rather than detailed analysis of speciﬁc materials. All the computed data is available in an open database.},

Their unique electronic properties allow to efficiently transduce physical and chemical stimuli into electric current. Their flexibility and nanometric thickness facilitate the adaption and adhesion to human body. The low opacity permits to obtain transparent devices. The good cellular adhesion and reduced cytotoxicity are advantageous for the integration of the devices in vivo.

Many distinct 2D materials have been explored in stretchable physical sensors, like nanowires, nanoribbons, carbon black, and carbon nanotubes. Recently, 2D materials such as MXenes, graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are garnering a lot of interest owing to their exceptional optical, mechanical, and electrical attributes. The factors like immense surface ratio and atomically thin thickness of 2D materials bestow great deformation and ultrahigh sensitivity to the external parameters (pressure, strain, temperature, humidity, etc.). The development of more effective and responsive 2D materials-based sensors would be made possible by a complete understanding of the fundamental process-structure-property interactions at the device level. In this review, we briefly discuss the structural pattern of materials incorporated in physical sensors, and their fabrication protocols, analyzing the mechanical behavior of 2D materials, printing techniques with their construction, and the research progress of wearable physical sensors for healthcare applications. Then, the pattern and application of conductive polymers for the manufacture of wearable electronics and the transformation of robust inorganic materials into flexible substrates have been investigated thoroughly. At last, the future perspectives and limitations that impede the commercialization of clinical devices are proposed.},

Herein, textiles used in everyday clothing are adapted to fabricate a flexible and vertical TE device architecture. Selective laser patterning is used to create cavities for embedding bulk inorganic Bi2Te3 legs into a knitted polyester fabric used in next-to-skin sportswear. The device thermal design is optimized using fabric layering to accommodate longer legs up to 0.8 mm, and a flexible 3D-printed heat sink is integrated to maximize heat dissipation to the ambient. Using flexible copper foil to connect the legs with a low-temperature soldering paste, a stable and ultralow device electrical resistance ({\textless}1 Ω) is achieved, which is unprecedented for wearable textile-based TE devices. The developed prototype demonstrates power generation of up to 3.8 μW using body heat, and it provides a cooling effect of 1 °C for personal thermoregulation. Furthermore, the prototype withstands a tensile strain up to 20\%, over 1000 bend cycles (at a 23 mm radius comparable with the curvature of the human wrist), and ten wash cycles, thereby demonstrating viability for TE clothing. Strategies for optimization are also presented to enable further performance enhancements using all textile-compatible processes.},

	abstract = {Cooling garments have gradually become one of the main ways to relieve the thermal stress of the human body. In this paper, a new type of liquid cooling garment prototype based on the principle of thermoelectric cooling is built. The human body wear experiment was carried out in a simulated high-temperature environment, and the water inlet temperature that could meet the minimum cooling requirements of the human body under different ambient temperatures and working intensities was determined. The experiment results show that exercise intensity will affect the cooling efficiency of cooling garment. The COP (coefficient of performance) of the cooling garment is 3.5, 4.1 and 4.7 respectively when the subjects were sitting still, walking and jogging. In order to meet the minimum cooling requirements of subjects performing high-intensity exercise in a high temperature environment of 40 °C, the temperature of the water inlet of the cooling garment should be kept at about 20 °C. Before and after wearing the cooling garment, the temperature in the microclimate regions decreased from 36.2 °C to 33 °C, and the relative humidity decreased from 100 \% to 60 \%, which proves that the cooling garment is effective in improving the thermal comfort of the human body in high temperature environment. The above experiment results provide parameter support for the intelligent regulation of liquid cooling garment in the future.},

Here we harness fluorescence originating from single-photon emitters at the surface of hexagonal boron nitride for molecular imaging and sensing in nanometrically confined liquids. The emission originates from the chemisorption of organic solvent molecules onto native surface defects, revealing single-molecule dynamics at the interface through the spatially correlated activation of neighbouring defects. Emitter spectra further offer a direct readout of the local dielectric properties, unveiling increasing dielectric order under nanometre-scale confinement.

	abstract = {Black phosphorus has been revisited recently as a new two-dimensional material showing potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Here we report the anisotropic in-plane thermal conductivity of suspended few-layer black phosphorus measured by micro-Raman spectroscopy. The armchair and zigzag thermal conductivities are ∼20 and ∼40 W m−1 K−1 for black phosphorus films thicker than 15 nm, respectively, and decrease to ∼10 and ∼20 W m−1 K−1 as the film thickness is reduced, exhibiting significant anisotropy. The thermal conductivity anisotropic ratio is found to be ∼2 for thick black phosphorus films and drops to ∼1.5 for the thinnest 9.5-nm-thick film. Theoretical modelling reveals that the observed anisotropy is primarily related to the anisotropic phonon dispersion, whereas the intrinsic phonon scattering rates are found to be similar along the armchair and zigzag directions. Surface scattering in the black phosphorus films is shown to strongly suppress the contribution of long mean-free-path acoustic phonons.},

	abstract = {Energy transport processes are critical for the efficiency of many optoelectronic applications. The energy transport in technologically promising transition metal dichalcogenides is determined by exciton diffusion, which strongly depends on the underlying excitonic and phononic dispersion. Based on a fully microscopic theory we demonstrate that the valley-exchange interaction leads to an enhanced exciton diffusion due to the emergence of a linear excitonic dispersion and the resulting decreased exciton-phonon scattering. Interestingly, we find that the application of a uniaxial strain can drastically boost the diffusion speed and even give rise to a pronounced anisotropic diffusion, which persists up to room temperature. We reveal that this behaviour originates from the highly anisotropic exciton dispersion in the presence of strain, displaying parabolic and linear behaviour perpendicular and parallel to the strain direction, respectively. Our work demonstrates the possibility to control the speed and direction of exciton diffusion via strain and dielectric engineering. This opens avenues for more efficient and exotic optoelectronic applications of atomically thin materials.},

Their properties are strongly affected by lattice distortions that can be created in a controlled way via strain. Here, we perform a joint theory-experiment study investigating exciton diffusion in strained tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayers. We reveal a non-trivial and non-monotonic influence of strain. Lattice deformations give rise to different energy shifts for bright and dark excitons changing the excitonic landscape, the efficiency of intervalley scattering channels and the weight of single exciton species to the overall exciton diffusion. We predict a minimal diffusion coefficient in unstrained WS2 followed by a steep speed-up by a factor of 3 for tensile biaxial strain at about 0.6\% strain—in excellent agreement with our experiments. The obtained microscopic insights on the impact of strain on exciton diffusion are applicable to a broad class of multi-valley 2D materials.},

Free excitons (A excitons) and bound excitons (XL excitons) can be seen in the low-temperature PL spectra. The radiative rates and nonradiative rates of the two kinds of excitons as a function of temperature can be calculated through the parameters derived from the PL and time-resolved PL spectra. As the temperature increases, the observed phenomena, including the red-shift of the center wavelength of the PL spectrum, the decrease of the PL intensity, and the shorter of the relaxation time, all can be explained by the temperature-dependence of the band structure of MoS2 and the temperature-dependence of the nonradiation process. The radiation process originates from excitons recombination in monolayer MoS2. The nonradiation process is due to defect trapping and thermal energy generation. The temperature-dependence of the radiation and nonradiation processes significantly affects the optical properties of the monolayer MoS2.},

	abstract = {Propelled partly by the Materials Genome Initiative, and partly by the algorithmic developments and the resounding successes of data-driven efforts in other domains, informatics strategies are beginning to take shape within materials science. These approaches lead to surrogate machine learning models that enable rapid predictions based purely on past data rather than by direct experimentation or by computations/simulations in which fundamental equations are explicitly solved. Data-centric informatics methods are becoming useful to determine material properties that are hard to measure or compute using traditional methods—due to the cost, time or effort involved—but for which reliable data either already exists or can be generated for at least a subset of the critical cases. Predictions are typically interpolative, involving fingerprinting a material numerically first, and then following a mapping (established via a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property of interest. Fingerprints, also referred to as “descriptors”, may be of many types and scales, as dictated by the application domain and needs. Predictions may also be extrapolative—extending into new materials spaces—provided prediction uncertainties are properly taken into account. This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the recent successful data-driven “materials informatics” strategies undertaken in the last decade, with particular emphasis on the fingerprint or descriptor choices. The review also identifies some challenges the community is facing and those that should be overcome in the near future.},

However, accurate measurement of the elastic modulus of 2D materials remains a challenge, and the conventional suspension method suffers from a number of drawbacks. In this work, we demonstrate a method to map the in-plane Young’s modulus of mono- and bi-layer MoS2 on a substrate with high spatial resolution. Bimodal atomic force microscopy is used to accurately map the effective spring constant between the microscope tip and sample, and a finite element method is developed to quantitatively account for the effect of substrate stiffness on deformation. Using these methods, the in-plane Young’s modulus of monolayer MoS2 can be decoupled from the substrate and determined as 265 ± 13 GPa, broadly consistent with previous reports though with substantially smaller uncertainty. It is also found that the elasticity of mono- and bi-layer MoS2 cannot be differentiated, which is confirmed by the first principles calculations. This method provides a convenient, robust and accurate means to map the in-plane Young’s modulus of 2D materials on a substrate.},

However, thoroughly and efficiently sampling the entire design space in a computationally tractable manner remains a highly challenging task. To tackle this problem, we propose an inverse design framework (MatDesINNe) utilizing invertible neural networks which can map both forward and reverse processes between the design space and target property. This approach can be used to generate materials candidates for a designated property, thereby satisfying the highly sought-after goal of inverse design. We then apply this framework to the task of band gap engineering in two-dimensional materials, starting with MoS2. Within the design space encompassing six degrees of freedom in applied tensile, compressive and shear strain plus an external electric field, we show the framework can generate novel, high fidelity, and diverse candidates with near-chemical accuracy. We extend this generative capability further to provide insights regarding metal-insulator transition in MoS2 which are important for memristive neuromorphic applications, among others. This approach is general and can be directly extended to other materials and their corresponding design spaces and target properties.},

Among the various techniques used to manufacture 2D crystals, mechanical exfoliation has been essential to practical applications and fundamental research. However, mechanically exfoliated crystals on substrates contain relatively thick flakes that must be found and removed manually, limiting high-throughput manufacturing of atomic 2D crystals and van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we present a deep-learning-based method to segment and identify the thickness of atomic layer flakes from optical microscopy images. Through carefully designing a neural network based on U-Net, we found that our neural network based on U-net trained only with the data based on realistically small number of images successfully distinguish monolayer and bilayer MoS2 and graphene with a success rate of 70–80\%, which is a practical value in the first screening process for choosing monolayer and bilayer flakes of all flakes on substrates without human eye.

	abstract = {The attainment of both high strength and high ductility is always the goal for structure materials, because the two properties generally are mutually competing, called strength-ductility trade-off. Nowadays, the data-driven paradigm combined with expert domain knowledge provides the state-of-the-art methodology to design and discovery for structure materials with high strength and high ductility. To enhance both strength and ductility, a joint feature is proposed here to be the product of strength multiplying ductility. The strategy of “divide and conquer” is developed to solve the contradictory problem, that material experimental data of mechanical behaviors are, in general, small in size and big in noise, while the design space is huge, by a newly developed data preprocessing algorithm, named the Tree-Classifier for Gaussian Process Regression (TCGPR). The TCGPR effectively divides an original dataset in a huge design space into three appropriate sub-domains and then three Machine Learning (ML) models conquer the three sub-domains, achieving significantly improved prediction accuracy and generality. After that the Bayesian sampling is applied to design next experiments by balancing exploitation and exploration. Finally, the experiment results confirm the ML predictions, exhibiting novel lead-free solder alloys with high strength high ductility. Various material characterizations were also conducted to explore the mechanism of high strength and high ductility of the alloys.},

One of the most exciting characteristics of 2D crystals is the ability to tune their properties via controllable introduction of defects. However, the search space for such structures is enormous, and ab-initio computations prohibitively expensive. We propose a machine learning approach for rapid estimation of the properties of 2D material given the lattice structure and defect configuration. The method suggests a way to represent configuration of 2D materials with defects that allows a neural network to train quickly and accurately. We compare our methodology with the state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate at least 3.7 times energy prediction error drop. Also, our approach is an order of magnitude more resource-efficient than its contenders both for the training and inference part.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the Raman Stokes peak position and its shift has been frequently used to estimate either temperature or stress in microelectronics and microelectromechanical system devices. However, if both fields are evolving simultaneously, the Stokes shift represents a convolution of these effects, making it difficult to measure either quantity accurately. By using the relative independence of the Stokes linewidth to applied stress, it is possible to deconvolve the signal into an estimation of both temperature and stress. Using this property, a method is presented whereby the temperature and stress were simultaneously measured in doped polysilicon microheaters. A data collection and analysis method was developed to reduce the uncertainty in the measured stresses resulting in an accuracy of ±40MPa for an average applied stress of −325MPa and temperature of 520°C. Measurement results were compared to three-dimensional finite-element analysis of the microheaters and were shown to be in excellent agreement. This analysis shows that Raman spectroscopy has the potential to measure both evolving temperature and stress fields in devices using a single optical measurement.},

One is the fundamental understanding of electrical and thermal transport, enabled by the interplay of theory and experiment; the other is the substantial enhancement of the performance of various thermoelectric materials, through synergistic optimisation of those intercorrelated transport parameters. Here we review some of the successful strategies for tuning electrical and thermal transport. For electrical transport, we start from the classical but still very active strategy of tuning band degeneracy (or band convergence), then discuss the engineering of carrier scattering, and finally address the concept of conduction channels and conductive networks that emerge in complex thermoelectric materials. For thermal transport, we summarise the approaches for studying thermal transport based on phonon–phonon interactions valid for conventional solids, as well as some quantitative efforts for nanostructures. We also discuss the thermal transport in complex materials with chemical-bond hierarchy, in which a portion of the atoms (or subunits) are weakly bonded to the rest of the structure, leading to an intrinsic manifestation of part-crystalline part-liquid state at elevated temperatures. In this review, we provide a summary of achievements made in recent studies of thermoelectric transport properties, and demonstrate how they have led to improvements in thermoelectric performance by the integration of modern theory and experiment, and point out some challenges and possible directions.},

The first-order temperature coefficients of Raman shifts are obtained to be −0.0093 (cm−1/K) and −0.0122 (cm−1/K) for and A1g peaks, respectively. A physical model, including thermal expansion and three- and four-phonon anharmonic effects, is used quantitatively to analyze the observed nonlinear temperature dependence. Thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of monolayer WS2 is extracted from the experimental data for the first time. It is found that thermal expansion coefficient of out-plane mode is larger than one of in-plane mode and TECs of and A1g modes are temperature-dependent weakly and strongly, respectively. It is also found that the nonlinear temperature dependence of Raman shift of mode mainly originates from the anharmonic effect of three-phonon process, whereas one of A1g mode is mainly contributed by thermal expansion effect in high temperature region, revealing that thermal expansion effect cannot be ignored.},

However, the immense phase space necessitates a high-throughput approach for an optimal interface design. Here we introduce a high-throughput computational framework, InterMatch, for efficiently predicting charge transfer, strain, and superlattice structure of an interface by leveraging the databases of individual bulk materials. Specifically, the algorithm reads in the lattice vectors, density of states, and the stiffness tensors for each material in their isolated form from the Materials Project. From these bulk properties, InterMatch estimates the interfacial properties. We benchmark InterMatch predictions for the charge transfer against experimental measurements and supercell density-functional theory calculations. We then use InterMatch to predict promising interface candidates for doping transition metal dichalcogenide MoSe2. Finally, we explain experimental observation of factor of 10 variation in the supercell periodicity within a few microns in graphene/α-RuCl3 by exploring low energy superlattice structures as a function of twist angle using InterMatch. We anticipate our open-source InterMatch algorithm accelerating and guiding ever-growing interfacial design efforts. Moreover, the interface database resulting from the InterMatch searches presented in this paper can be readily accessed online.},

A materials acceleration platform (MAP) typically encompasses several experimental techniques or instruments to establish a synthesis-characterization-evaluation workflow. With the advancement of workflow orchestration software and AI experiment design, the scope and complexity of MAPs are increasing, however each MAP typically operates as a standalone entity with dedicated experiment, compute, and database resources. The data from each MAP is thus siloed until subsequent efforts to integrate data into complex schema such as knowledge graphs. To lower the latency of data integration and establish an extensible community of MAPs, we must expand our automation efforts to include data handling that is decoupled from the resources of each MAP. Event-driven pipelines are well established in the computational community for building decoupled data processing systems. Such pipelines can be difficult to implement de novo due to their distributed nature and complex error handling. Fortunately, the broader computational science community has established a suite of cloud services that are well suited for this task. By leveraging cloud computing resources to establish event-driven data management, the MAP community can better realize the ideals of extensibility and interoperability in materials chemistry research.},

              Exploratory synthesis has been the main generator of new inorganic materials for decades. However, our Edisonian and bias-prone processes of synthetic exploration alone are no longer sufficient in an age that demands rapid advances in materials development. In this work, we demonstrate an end-to-end attempt towards systematic, computer-aided discovery and laboratory synthesis of inorganic crystalline compounds as a modern alternative to purely exploratory synthesis. Our approach initializes materials discovery campaigns by autonomously mapping the synthetic feasibility of a chemical system using density functional theory with AI feedback. Following expert-driven down-selection of newly generated phases, we use solid-state synthesis and

              characterization
              via
              hot-stage X-ray diffraction in order to realize new ternary oxide phases experimentally. We applied this strategy in six ternary transition-metal oxide chemistries previously considered well-explored, one of which culminated in the discovery of two novel phases of calcium ruthenates. Detailed characterization using room temperature X-ray powder diffraction, 4D-STEM and SQUID measurements identifies the structure and composition and confirms distinct properties, including distinct defect concentrations, of one of the new phases formed in our experimental campaigns. While the discovery of a new material guided by AI and DFT theory represents a milestone, our procedure and results also highlight a number of critical gaps in the process that can inform future efforts towards the improvement of AI-coupled methodologies.},

	abstract = {The intensity response of polarized Raman is studied using backscattered Raman spectroscopy. In previous works, it was conﬁrmed that the Raman intensities of the E21g modes for WS2 and MoS2 as well as the G mode of graphene are independent of the polarization angle. However, a strong correlation is found between them in this work using a confocal Raman system. The E21g and A1g modes of nanometer-thick WS2 and MoS2 samples as well as the G mode of bulk graphene are used to investigate the polarization dependency of the Raman intensity for each mode. Additionally, the eﬀects of temperature and sample structure on the Raman intensity are studied using the WS2 sample on both suspended and supported areas. Results of these experiments are explained and ﬁtted by the theoretical Raman intensity proﬁles. This theoretical study is conducted using the classical theory of polarized Raman spectroscopy and includes all the information about polarization of excitation laser, rotation of the beam splitter, and diﬀerent vibrational modes of samples, which is considered in Raman tensors. It is concluded that Raman intensity variation with incident laser polarization not only is a function of the material structure but also carries information about the optical functionality of the Raman system.},

Herein, for the first time, we present a new method, optothermal Raman spectroscopy (OT-Raman), for identifying crystalline orientation. With a physical mechanism based on the anisotropic optical absorption of the polarized laser and the resulting heating, the OT-Raman can identify the crystalline orientation explicitly, regardless of excitation wavelength and sample thickness, by Raman frequency–power differential Φ (=∂ω/∂P). The parameter Φ has the largest (smallest) value when the laser polarization is along the armchair (zigzag) direction. The OT-Raman technique is robust and is able to identify the crystalline orientation of BP samples with thicknesses up to 300 nm at a minimum and potentially as high as 1200 nm.},

	abstract = {Abstract The last decade has witnessed a flourish in 2D materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as atomic-scale Legos. Artificial moiré superlattices via stacking 2D materials with a twist angle and/or a lattice mismatch have recently become a fertile playground exhibiting a plethora of emergent properties beyond their building blocks. These rich quantum phenomena stem from their nontrivial electronic structures that are effectively tuned by the moiré periodicity. Modern angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures with decent momentum, energy, and spatial resolution, thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moiré superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. In this review, first, a brief introduction is given on advanced ARPES techniques and basic ideas of band structures in a moiré superlattice system. Then ARPES research results of various moiré superlattice systems are highlighted, including graphene on substrates with small lattice mismatches, twisted graphene/TMD moiré systems, and high-order moiré superlattice systems. Finally, it discusses important questions that remain open, challenges in current experimental investigations, and presents an outlook on this field of research.},

This Review presents the contemporary experimental and theoretical understanding of these interlayer excitons. We discuss their unique optical properties arising from the underlying valley physics, the strong many-body interactions and electrical control resulting from the electric dipole moment, and the unique effects of a moiré superlattice on the interlayer exciton potential landscape and optical properties.},

	abstract = {Atomically thin layers of two-dimensional materials can be assembled in vertical stacks that are held together by relatively weak van der Waals forces, enabling coupling between monolayer crystals with incommensurate lattices and arbitrary mutual rotation1,2. Consequently, an overarching periodicity emerges in the local atomic registry of the constituent crystal structures, which is known as a moiré superlattice3. In graphene/hexagonal boron nitride structures4, the presence of a moiré superlattice can lead to the observation of electronic minibands5–7, whereas in twisted graphene bilayers its effects are enhanced by interlayer resonant conditions, resulting in a superconductor–insulator transition at magic twist angles8. Here, using semiconducting heterostructures assembled from incommensurate molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayers, we demonstrate that excitonic bands can hybridize, resulting in a resonant enhancement of moiré superlattice effects. MoSe2 and WS2 were chosen for the near-degeneracy of their conduction-band edges, in order to promote the hybridization of intra- and interlayer excitons. Hybridization manifests through a pronounced exciton energy shift as a periodic function of the interlayer rotation angle, which occurs as hybridized excitons are formed by holes that reside in MoSe2 binding to a twist-dependent superposition of electron states in the adjacent monolayers. For heterostructures in which the monolayer pairs are nearly aligned, resonant mixing of the electron states leads to pronounced effects of the geometrical moiré pattern of the heterostructure on the dispersion and optical spectra of the hybridized excitons. Our findings underpin strategies for band-structure engineering in semiconductor devices based on van der Waals heterostructures9.},

Here, we uncover the atomistic origin of the observed friction domains using a cantilever torsion microscopy in conjunction with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We experimentally demonstrate that ripples on graphene are formed along the zigzag direction of the hexagonal lattice. The formation of zigzag directional ripple is consistent with our theoretical model that takes account of the atomic-scale bending stiffness of carbon-carbon bonds and the interaction of graphene with the substrate. The correlation between micrometer-scale ripple alignment and atomic-scale arrangement of exfoliated monolayer graphene is first discovered and suggests a practical tool for measuring lattice orientation of graphene.},

Defects are induced by irradiation of graphene with the low-energy electron beam (20 keV) and quantified by the Raman D-to-G peak intensity ratio. As the defect density changes from 2.0 × 1010 cm−2 to 1.8 × 1011 cm−2 the thermal conductivity decreases from ∼(1.8 ± 0.2) × 103 W mK−1 to ∼(4.0 ± 0.2) × 102 W mK−1 near room temperature. At higher defect densities, the thermal conductivity reveals an intriguing saturation-type behavior at a relatively high value of ∼400 W mK−1. The thermal conductivity dependence on the defect density is analyzed using the Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations.

A ≈20 nm thick CoPt multilayer with perpendicular magnetization serves as the heater and thermometer in the experiment. The low thermal conductivity and small thickness of the CoPt transducer improve the sensitivity of the measurement to lateral heat flow in the MoS2 crystal. The thermal conductivity of MoS2 is highly anisotropic with basal-plane thermal conductivity varying between 85–110 W m-1 K-1 as a function of laser spot size. The basal-plane thermal conductivity is a factor of ≈50 larger than the c-axis thermal conductivity, 2.0±0.3 W m-1 K-1.},

In this report, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) across MoS2 and graphene monolayers with SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates is systematically investigated using a custom-made electrical thermometry platform followed by 3D finite element analyses. Through comparative experiments, the TBC at 295 K across MoS2 is found to be 20.3–33.5 MW m−2 K−1 on SiO2/Si, and 19–37.5 MW m−2 K−1 on c-sapphire, respectively, but far larger than the previous Raman-based measurements on TMDs with optical heating (0.1–2 MW m−2 K−1). This study also investigates the effects of processing quality and potential interface contaminants, substrate properties, and encapsulation on TBC across MoS2 and graphene monolayers. Our results reveal that the emergence of Rayleigh wave modes dramatically contributes to the interfacial conductance across encapsulated 2D monolayers.

	abstract = {Non-metallic crystalline materials conduct heat by the transport of quantized atomic lattice vibrations called phonons. Thermal conductivity depends on how far phonons travel between scattering events—their mean free paths. Due to the breadth of the phonon mean free path spectrum, nanostructuring materials can reduce thermal conductivity from bulk by scattering long mean free path phonons, whereas short mean free path phonons are unaffected. Here we use a breakdown in diffusive phonon transport generated by high-frequency surface temperature modulation to identify the mean free path-dependent contributions of phonons to thermal conductivity in crystalline and amorphous silicon. Our measurements probe a broad range of mean free paths in crystalline silicon spanning 0.3–8.0 μm at a temperature of 311 K and show that 40±5\% of its thermal conductivity comes from phonons with mean free path {\textgreater}1 μm. In a 500 nm thick amorphous silicon film, despite atomic disorder, we identify propagating phonon-like modes that contribute {\textgreater}35±7\% to thermal conductivity at a temperature of 306 K.},

The properties of the transducer and its interface to the sample are then important to the interpretation of results, and heat conduction in the transducer layer can limit measurements of ultra-thin samples or in-plane conductivity. We demonstrate the feasibility of measuring semiconductor samples using standard TDTR instrumentation, without the use of a metal transducer. A mathematical model accounting for non-zero laser penetration depth as well as both thermal and charge carrier effects is presented, and the ability of the model to describe and fit to experimental data for silicon and germanium samples is demonstrated. Though at this stage measurement uncertainties are larger than for traditional TDTR, we anticipate that the use of this technique will expand the range of samples that can be measured with existing TDTR setups.},

We find that 78 percent of the Kapitza conductance is due to sub-20 THz flexural acoustic modes, and that a resonance mechanism dominates the interfacial phonon transport. MD and NEGF estimate the classical Kapitza conductance to be hK ≈ 10 to 16 MW K−1 m−2 at 300 K, respectively, consistent with existing experimental observations. Taking into account quantum mechanical corrections, this value is approximately 28\% lower at 300 K. Our calculations also suggest that hK scales as T2 at low temperatures (T \&lt; 100 K) due to the linear frequency dependence of phonon transmission across the graphene-SiO2 interface at low frequencies. Our study sheds light on the role of flexural acoustic phonons in heat dissipation from graphene to its substrate.},

Here we experimentally demonstrate that moderate strain values ({\textasciitilde}2\%) can already trigger an indirect bandgap transition and induce a finite charge carrier density in 2D MoS2 layers. A conclusive proof of the direct-to-indirect bandgap transition is provided by directly comparing the electronic and optical bandgaps of strained MoS2 single layers obtained from tunneling spectroscopy and photoluminescence measurements of MoS2 nanobubbles. Upon 2\% biaxial tensile strain, the electronic gap becomes significantly smaller (1.45 ± 0.15 eV) than the optical direct gap (1.73 ± 0.1 eV), clearly evidencing a strain-induced direct to indirect bandgap transition. Moreover, the Fermi level can shift inside the conduction band already in moderately strained ({\textasciitilde}2\%) MoS2 single layers conferring them a metallic character.},

MoS2 samples, encapsulated in between polyethylene terephthalate (PET) of octadecagonal shape and a layer of polymethlmethacrylate (PMMA), were bended in order to apply uniaxial tensile strain along different directions of MoS2. For bulk MoS2, the Raman shift rates of the E12g and A1g modes (the change of the Raman peak position versus strain level) were very small and almost the same for strains applied along different directions. On the other hand, the Raman shift rates of few layers MoS2 were larger than those in bulk MoS2. In addition, they also exhibited distinctive anisotropic strain responses. On the basis of our results, we believe that the armchair and zigzag directions of the exfoliated MoS2 might be determined by monitoring the variation of Raman shifts of the E12g and A1g modes in different strained directions of MoS2.},

In this work, we demonstrate the possibility to subject micrometric regions of atomically-thin molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) to giant strains with the desired ordering. Mechanically-deformed MoS2 membranes can be obtained by proton-irradiation of bulk flakes, leading to the formation of monolayer domes containing pressurized hydrogen. By pre-patterning the flakes via deposition of polymeric masks and electron beam lithography, we show that it is possible not only to control the size and position of the domes, but also to create a mechanical constraint. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that this constraint alters remarkably the morphology of the domes, otherwise subject to universal scaling laws. Upon the optimization of the irradiation and patterning processes, unprecedented periodic configurations of large strain gradients -estimated by numerical simulations- are created, with the highest strains being close to the rupture critical values ({\textgreater} 10 \%). The creation of such high strains is confirmed by Raman experiments. The method proposed here represents an important step towards the strain engineering of twodimensional crystals.},

Such a breakthrough could also enable the control of heat flow using thermal circuits, in a manner analogous to electronic circuits.

We use spatially-resolved time-domain thermoreflectance to map the lithium ion distribution during device operation, and atomic force microscopy to show that the lithiated state correlates with increased thickness and surface roughness. First principles calculations reveal that the thermal conductance modulation is due to phonon scattering by lithium rattler modes, c-axis strain, and stacking disorder. This study lays the foundation for electrochemically-driven nanoscale thermal regulators, and establishes thermal metrology as a useful probe of spatio-temporal intercalant dynamics in nanomaterials.},

Application of TMDCs is hampered, however, by their insignificant power factors which cancel the advantage of their intrinsically low thermal conductivities along the cross-plane direction and lead to less satisfactory overall thermoelectric performances. Here we report that, by adopting an oxygen doping strategy, the thermoelectric efficiency of MoS2 can be enhanced up to 50 times with the best performance appearing along the cross-plane direction. Our further characterization suggests that this plausible improvement originates from the MoO2 nanoinclusions, which enhance the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, while suppressing the thermal conductivity at the same time. The unexpected simultaneous enhancement of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient after doping is explained using an electron relaxation time model. We therefore provide a general strategy towards improving the thermoelectric performance of TMDCs.},

Although the emission characteristics of interlayer excitons have been studied, efficient manipulation of their valley states, a necessary requirement for information encoding, is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate comprehensive electrical control of interlayer excitons in a MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure. Encapsulation of our well-aligned stack with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) allows us to resolve two separate narrow interlayer transitions with opposite helicities under circularly polarized excitation, either preserving or reversing the polarization of incoming light. By electrically controlling their relative intensities, we realize a polarization switch with tunable emission intensity and wavelength. Finally, we observe large g-factors of these two transitions on application of an external magnetic field. These results are interpreted within the picture of moiré-induced brightening of forbidden optical transitions. The ability to control the polarization of interlayer excitons is a step towards the manipulation of the valley degree of freedom in realistic device applications.},

	abstract = {Aluminum alloys have been extensively used as heatproof and heat-dissipation components in automotive and communication industries, and the demand for aluminum alloys with higher thermal conductivity is increasing. Therefore, this review focuses on the thermal conductivity of aluminum alloys. First, we formulate the theory of thermal conduction of metals and effective medium theory, and then analyze the effect of alloying elements, secondary phases, and temperature on the thermal conductivity of aluminum alloys. Alloying elements are the most crucial factor, whose species, existing states, and mutual interactions significantly affect the thermal conductivity of aluminum. Alloying elements in a solid solution weaken the thermal conductivity of aluminum more dramatically than those in the precipitated state. The characteristics and morphology of secondary phases also affect thermal conductivity. Temperature also affects thermal conductivity by influencing the thermal conduction of electrons and phonons in aluminum alloys. Furthermore, recent studies on the effects of casting, heat treatment, and AM processes on the thermal conductivity of aluminum alloys are summarized, in which processes mainly affect thermal conductivity by varying existing states of alloying elements and the morphology of secondary phases. These analyses and summaries will further promote the industrial design and development of aluminum alloys with high thermal conductivity.},

	abstract = {Non-metallic crystalline materials conduct heat by the transport of quantized atomic lattice vibrations called phonons. Thermal conductivity depends on how far phonons travel between scattering events—their mean free paths. Due to the breadth of the phonon mean free path spectrum, nanostructuring materials can reduce thermal conductivity from bulk by scattering long mean free path phonons, whereas short mean free path phonons are unaffected. Here we use a breakdown in diffusive phonon transport generated by high-frequency surface temperature modulation to identify the mean free path-dependent contributions of phonons to thermal conductivity in crystalline and amorphous silicon. Our measurements probe a broad range of mean free paths in crystalline silicon spanning 0.3–8.0 μm at a temperature of 311 K and show that 40±5\% of its thermal conductivity comes from phonons with mean free path {\textgreater}1 μm. In a 500 nm thick amorphous silicon film, despite atomic disorder, we identify propagating phonon-like modes that contribute {\textgreater}35±7\% to thermal conductivity at a temperature of 306 K.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the thermal properties of MoS2 is important for the design of electronic devices based on this material. We used frequency domain thermoreflectance to study the cross-plane thermal transport in mechanically exfoliated MoS2 samples supported on SiO2 and muscovite mica substrates. The thickness of MoS2 ranged between one and five layers, and the MoS2 layers were sandwiched between a metal layer and the substrate. In the case of mica, heat transport into the substrate remained the same whether or not a monolayer of MoS2 was present, whereas, for SiO2, heat transport was reduced by surface roughness. We observed a significant improvement in heat transport across monolayer MoS2 as compared to few layer MoS2. For MoS2 on SiO2, the effective thermal interface conductance was improved by more than three times if a monolayer was used. For MoS2 on mica, the thermal interface conductance was approximately two times better for monolayer MoS2. This implies that monolayer MoS2 has superior thermal properties and can be used in electronic devices as an intermediate layer between two materials. Additionally, we also report on the measurement of anisotropic thermal conductivity in bulk MoS2 and mica.},
