Hello! And welcome to my website. 

I am a Materials Science & Engineering PhD candidate at Stanford University studying the thermal and excitonic properties of atomically thin or "two-dimensional" (2D) materials. At Stanford, I am a [Graduate Fellow](https://tomkat.stanford.edu/people/amalya-johnson) in the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy. I am a recent recipient of a US Department of Energy Office of Science [Graduate Student Research Award](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr), and currently conduct my doctoral research at the [Molecular Foundry](https://foundry.lbl.gov/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Find more details on my research [here](https://amalyacox.github.io/research/), my first first-author paper [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj8819), and all of my publications [here](https://amalyacox.github.io/publications/).  

I earned my Bachelors in Physics from Columbia University, where I was a [4-year starter](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2019/11/12/one-of-the-best-players-in-the-history-of-this-program-amalya-johnson-ends-a-career-filled-with-many-accolades-and-even-more-memories/) and senior captain of the Women's Soccer Team. These days, I spend my saturdays watching NCAA Women's Soccer, the NWSL, the EPL, or [LaLiga](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Mes_que_un_club-FC_Barcelona.JPG), and run a lot.
